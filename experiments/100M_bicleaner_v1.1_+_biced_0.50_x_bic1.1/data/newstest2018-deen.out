Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - yet very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online tickets .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognise as such .
in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ sus sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops came off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph further strengthened the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the submission sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the insur@@ gency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered copies from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ bs &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els now show no farmers there - but small farmers in the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has been working for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich meet on the grounds of the former prison hospital .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the soccer field of the TS@@ V München Ost , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered by 18@@ 56 as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger Street was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 will be the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn &apos;s regular circuit .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof .
citizen Rights Group publishes Mis@@ sour@@ i Travel warning
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , requires special attention from af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , since a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently @-@ approved Mis@@ sour@@ i law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination and prosec@@ uting authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office that shows that black mot@@ orists are 75 percent more common in the state than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring some deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations which will contribute to further racial pro@@ spec@@ ting in the view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric fence project is elementary &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wei@@ de@@ wit@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will be continued next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac received a picture on the ground .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties in the administrative court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insight into his operation , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows , according to Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also the chairman of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fis@@ her@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot generate profit on such steep grounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , much need to be edited with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over his par@@ ental operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not lead organic farming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and wor@@ rying about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the area of open space is 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were encouraged , a quarter contributed to the community of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmer left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women in the countryside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) in Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of fen@@ cing f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area to be f@@ enced off may not be economically viable ( inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fis@@ her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open @-@ plan area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for a dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller gra@@ bbed the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ insul@@ ators would have learned it if he had done it .
but he picked up its significance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta cried : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is technically correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the US Tr@@ ump@@ et .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who set themselves up to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical image .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not to light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh came across quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great fan@@ ciful deed was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to light the way , but the hatred , which is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ da@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two ball@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
the power director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chers - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was selected by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sc@@ ot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alists , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , say that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mid @-@ length runner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir goes on this road and has set five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 35@@ ,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another shot that was to be observed after a great season that included the victory with the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Schot@@ ten , which belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Facebook critics : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the pre@@ heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he shou@@ ted at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union thus su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and to play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
this is why the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate the whi@@ p online .
the mail addressed some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled with water but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other up @-@ to @-@ date news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same topic , then they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical Colum@@ ni@@ sts and to arrest or silence prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones in this question was last week in Virginia .
according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , ex@@ iled a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of papers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck his lead .
and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Washington made decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , were overwhel@@ med by the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who in the past year led to the final round at Arch@@ er@@ field , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as she was taken out of the program in the year after I won her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the back of his home .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pulmon@@ ary cancer deaths are due to passive smoke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Prof. Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany because of passive smoking .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
sli@@ ppers turn out to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than presum@@ ed , as there is a lot of mountains hiding underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which repeatedly ham@@ pers the construction work , represents a major problem for the contractor St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were fed by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai brand in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the su@@ ed tu@@ ber is taken out and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example , clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in an empty space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public raising in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the town , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corru@@ gated metal roofs that were transformed by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Indonesia , Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port reduced gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .
in addition , in the value of estimated $ 78 billion , Papua New Zealand owns wood resources .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all losing everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report from the 2016 Erz@@ di@@ ö@@ z@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are especially popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
bolts have intensified because Pap@@ u@@ as resources make a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping can@@ te@@ ens sell roast chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetable with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants started selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market more che@@ ap@@ ly than local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua New Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 district of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua people have changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and sm@@ ote the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
a child , aged 16 , Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children assembled on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle contin@@ ously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ting - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some prot@@ esters began to spin stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imminent danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who was witness to shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans bear only one name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about kill@@ ings only came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks later Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura made a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historic ab@@ uses in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he would implement an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90@@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto was forced to retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , accused by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting didn &apos;t stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a farmer who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly here , &quot; said the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting place for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by bombar@@ ding spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top @-@ ranking leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region tend to go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rarely have capital or skills necessary to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions in Papua , although they gave them rare permission for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign to aboli@@ sh the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report of Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ying and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the clan council .
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims offered a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said an inhabit@@ ant named George ang@@ as , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that fighting fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said she was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in Britain the police told them that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport , Davis Cup sing@@ ular was only to be played on two swe@@ ep@@ stak@@ es , ultra thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although they are often very long , but also very well @-@ valued five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition is preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until the vote , after many claims , the proposal had already come to bring the final to a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new starting in 2018 is only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the next round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring forbidden objects into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ intentionally prohibited items were smu@@ g@@ gled by U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally carried out prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was carried out with more than 1,000 people - driven by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also found that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed who stated that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were m@@ illenni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that have been deliberately b@@ yp@@ assed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to know@@ ingly wore items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dently made smu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids can take them or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has under@@ mined that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k reveals another , less brilliant figure for the first time in announ@@ cing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose delivery has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non@@ com@@ mitt@@ al reservations envis@@ age , mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models should be combined - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
anyone who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines ever tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are major delays , the integrity of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from run away in dro@@ ves .
EPA head of P@@ ru@@ itt back on account of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline that was running on 1st October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay his compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal return for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfil@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not met the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then waited to be accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to establish an appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intend to uph@@ old legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their congreg@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the prot@@ ru@@ ding smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year thousands of premature deaths contribute .
public health representatives and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts &apos;s surprising exchange of courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cru@@ el@@ ty of the Tr@@ ump government to encourage environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30@@ pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius site is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters tum@@ bling to their request .
Walter Martin@@ i emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Docum@@ entary Book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , on the tum@@ ble hill outside the former parish church there was also a magnificent court , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was owned and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 it was adjacent to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the beautiful settlement core of the village .
old maps of the time around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was born from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied it with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
connected with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was wre@@ cked at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed down during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius gra@@ vey@@ ard was also the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ary Church was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left standing .
during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the bell tower and half fell .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ wer@@ g which is still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ enti@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; Schaff@@ y Rent@@ als &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn are the Hil@@ arius machines .
as organis@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s name is the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers show up the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade happens only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of great importance for Tum@@ ours and hear@@ ers .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to homeland care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association wants to permit approval of wind turbines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraged Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been authorized , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at that time in Vier@@ sen .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but had not approved Düsseldorf &apos;s district government because of a mold failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the missing planning legal requirement , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the wind conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; the district government &apos;s approval is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the district of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the point of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four four @-@ 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large grounds .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NEW &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible road accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was hurt mort@@ ally .
two other people were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch covered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother .
city and dealers are planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise customers &apos; awareness of what offers their own city is in store away from the usual supermarket merchandise .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mid@@ night @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade association and the city are thus entering another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - up to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly wi@@ dened , had told King in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , would take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
beside Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the operation under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour directly .

Tr@@ ump seated after penet@@ rated tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump ordered a telephone call to the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to tell publicly that he would not pay for a planned border .
the US president compla@@ ined that he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and Sw@@ or , Mexico to pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and disclosed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was con@@ veys by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after it had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury travelled through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence , when a young black man was torn apart by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one copy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them hit the audience very real sigh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been l@@ ul@@ led by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congreg@@ ations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in the organisation of the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia &apos;s Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor put a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chen on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching Process .
but no one ever was indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remained on a free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer elections .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ings according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ com &apos;s black paint ten@@ ant , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors were in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby they wore didn &apos;t come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is clear , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ x because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated view over the play .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com who scre@@ ams H@@ ester and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cries , shots , and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dress of mour@@ ning stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays , a pra@@ g@@ matic speech called &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators face sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
one pair arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until that point the kill@@ ings have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy as if he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair from Atlanta chat@@ ted about the imitation with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which feeling had left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ching continues to go on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds yard at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner Society in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is setting on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) can be used to display a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the wall of the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ mort@@ als pos@@ ing as rock g@@ uns@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhein@@ gold - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cig@@ ars a body in the luggage compartment and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with great applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ily , who hum@@ bly bends his hands towards the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual wear .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a g@@ lowing pipe concert , five years later , there were big che@@ ers in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is noticeable that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf but also an understanding of their vision .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount working as a volunteer
they work at several locations in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week , I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with teenagers , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , therefore a late @-@ born volunteer .
how does that come about ?
question : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed .
I realized for myself that it &apos;s a wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what you are doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social system .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different uses during the volunte@@ ering service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon service .
for me it was just the right thing that mat@@ ured for me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really worked out .
what is different from the degree of civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating extras .
you always have other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a young man from the family has been brought out of the family - one must always respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a much .
much love , great kindness .
there are sometimes negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts down 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut down its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , declared NATO statement .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban back from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , to the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulating the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that states are oblig@@ ated to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency for the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ otes 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it will show the Agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA head Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental accus@@ ations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth .
the efforts have , however , triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature reserves that worry about the impact of major emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen the respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
joint mandate wants joint space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the com@@ unity of flu@@ ke @-@ tw@@ ins decides the establishment of a common room in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the church community has so far belonged to the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be carried out by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering over such a common area not as a meeting point for the residents of the just living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knit@@ ted café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the running budget last autumn , will be made by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , so T@@ j@@ aden reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw b@@ ill@@ ets between the legs in this respect , the statement that both saddle and pitch roof - which reduces the pitch height and makes the building more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : it is in tune with the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not move so well , for that you now lean to the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s motion to properly split the resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we grasp the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with auto : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer direction from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not look at the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern Munich has to refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup comes without him : David Al@@ aba will have to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel provisions the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory season of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel take care of the German football record champion Bayern Munich in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund again and again .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to do without the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the last six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical shape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights will captiv@@ ate the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 viewers , divided by the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the Har@@ z from Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to form the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information of many har@@ z@@ go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good @-@ to @-@ reach installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired include St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a part in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path Ticket to Ride is to be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ base , the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is far more distant .
also in which con@@ stellation the star con@@ veys a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye are clearly visible .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there are something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ - the Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community railway ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to down@@ gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 @-@ meter @-@ away sun is at least 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to greet the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ ated Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ vision world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asc@@ ended for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to lightweight weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is the demand for the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound ster@@ ling this year to arrange for the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later openly expressed himself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ oned Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after punc@@ tured tire
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 a.m. just before the post office market wide .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stood on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour , followed by the traffic on the left lane at the accident site .

Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig after 2 : 2 that optim@@ ising the defence formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first win of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents have been against Braunschweig on 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s def@@ ector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain chain is also to be optimised further .
and a fool according to a stum@@ bling block doesn &apos;t want to catch up with the Fort@@ une .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the three @-@ chain preparations than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford so many play mistakes in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann , of course , moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak of an un@@ decided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a ladder to as@@ cen@@ sion in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Fort@@ una &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly the guests from the Rhin@@ eland form a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we will sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s coach coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application test published
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who underwent a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ t@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the under@@ estimated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investig@@ ates the 5@@ 81 published results , she realized that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Traffic in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is planned for October and light is sure that the schedule is adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is a marginal for@@ tification , which is also used as operating distance .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge crane is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to proceed .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been provided with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires special finger @-@ tip .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pastures in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is lane @-@ controlled by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest in Indian potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the District Day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad coalition that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle doesn &apos;t invite Ron@@ dell to the &quot; great election campaign op@@ ener &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle .
and famous names on the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ athletes , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the well , but is now on the parking place below the fund - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is offered .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forums The World and one of the relevant organizers , is pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ancient potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence , especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcano @-@ Ei@@ fel reports that he has stri@@ ved for such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking places because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes .
now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D @-@ Event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police cannot move - no special occur@@ ren@@ ces .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz Orchestra N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating total artwork .
this core piece of the program was first premi@@ ered this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart said openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately sm@@ iled bit@@ terly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin asser@@ ts against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I have updated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ pered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered especially under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt frigh@@ tened , frigh@@ tened and sh@@ amed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats removed themselves from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working on it to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party from top to bottom without guidance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Recommen@@ dations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships that begin in London on Friday , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
on Monday , the Director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for res@@ etting .
drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
a funeral ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers are thought to have fallen in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ resolved fall @-@ down affair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benef@@ ici@@ aries of their trade &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ tmann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Premier Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ bear@@ ers lay down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of Le@@ yen described the surrounding soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sat@@ anic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ manns designed the flying operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show that Le@@ yen did not show : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the King &apos;s House shared on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Dom@@ kirche .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , and she was still in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ re@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself equal in relation to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
the last resting place of the 83 year old is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ crat , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife continued to flee the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk h@@ ul@@ ls instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation in this country to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP of potential majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
because he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green Party from its parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
head of the CD@@ U , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his group to include them .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Regional Day , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14th next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Land@@ tag withdraw@@ s confidence and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all questions if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west &apos;s pace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called herself a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land day mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we assume that she has received her Land@@ tag mandate , which she received from the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the provincial president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ears extraordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we can &apos;t understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the accession of the Lower Saxony Socialist MEP El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the social democr@@ ats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the country day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their past vanity and fru@@ stration , the politicians point their personal interests against the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty trick and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with personal career plans .
at that time the CD@@ U was in front of the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the Land@@ tag .
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) spoke and answered in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ Char@@ gen .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs are out of supply - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dis@@ may of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has just as much concern as makers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of eggs exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production plants do not have immediate guilt .
rather , they have to face economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always there are too few inspec@@ tors in the seri@@ ousness .
is it missing only at the staff or the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered this process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 per cent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a comprehensive explanation from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular emergency food really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
by means of the pan@@ eled means manufacturers , dealers and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in keeping food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps .
how the F@@ TT &apos;s financial rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues from the European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfers from Spain to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come from the UEF@@ A for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid € 2@@ 22 million ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can secure the money with security so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and brings him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
clubs may apply a lot of money to buy players , but they have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that enable them to break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini was dis@@ gra@@ ced by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to shy away from excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G purchased the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the plan of selling prices for the next five years can be indicated in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4m in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , located in the possession of Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s PS@@ G payments could be made via payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 20@@ 22 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ at@@ ari 20@@ 22 deny that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors will be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators to be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to avoid any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect fair play because it is possible to have different paths or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ oter supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; on request from the news agency s@@ da .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate sho@@ oters are distributed to 14 grams per year the flight atten@@ dant before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to make any information about the costs .
according to industry insi@@ ders , the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest s@@ wis@@ s chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
since 2006 , Swiss chocolate bars distribute the Swiss eggs on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
at the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the customers of First Class are spo@@ ilt by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class wet passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class , is also distributed on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes into the niche in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective . &quot;
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge @-@ era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter did the sketch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for promising lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle aged play hor@@ ny kids that will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; with his grown @-@ ups who now play adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering process principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand , Die Wie@@ ge schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character goes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) involved , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lower lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ins@@ an@@ ity that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang as she will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now ev@@ okes a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west ring @-@ combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited for a lower length , could better deliver his agit@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ tional Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Kon@@ stanz announced on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials made large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand Prix was accompanied by four function@@ aries from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with a close relationship to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
wise lam@@ bs large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er responsible for the refugee management of the German federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are registered , including 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases dates have been found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum@@ mar@@ ises the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficiently paid people , moreover , EU citizens are registered , who would not have to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assur@@ ances led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF is carrying out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the entry barrier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send them back there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening human un@@ lawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who with his 100 donations now distributed 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the congregation hon@@ ors the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingenious how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change in the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry numbered the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions .

the Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month reluct@@ ant to increase as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly assessment report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the coming years interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth economic package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak short @-@ term because the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool down inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphasized that elev@@ ations would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to rise compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on an increase in interest and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening gets worse before it gets better .
she added that in the coming years , monetary policy could not &quot; prevent the start of income , &quot; but she added that wages will &quot; clearly &quot; recover at the end of its three @-@ year forecasts .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the fall of the net . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years before it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an interest rate increased , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
the inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the transgres@@ sion in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ br@@ y , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages lock out , and many with due @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in N@@ HS in September following a fight against the high Court against financing the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p despite claiming that the local authorities should fund him .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) referred to it as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to facilitate the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV @-@ based preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or as long as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people suffering from HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , appropriate participants identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is estimated to be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges facing humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted specifically on people in need and vulnerable , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is genu@@ inely individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow secretary of health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former owner with a passion for real estate , settled in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down through the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lins lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all jo@@ ys and j@@ ars of jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperialist Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and their assets .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler and shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded it .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to add the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ences from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ anne@@ au of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co there when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to return her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke and Mark are both Mark and Mark , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered via SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and put our family name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece by Re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame junk by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February facing Poli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the sl@@ ump Twitter habit under control is to make sure that his personal media consumption ent@@ ails a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about - that Tr@@ ump@@ et T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers managed to keep his anger away from him several times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented it from creating tr@@ ump controversi@@ es .
one part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump materials that might promote their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to give the president for strategic reasons du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press releases , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out where they originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone un@@ willingly accused the president of a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief @-@ staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has vo@@ iced her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the most sought after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action following winter on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting hidden away from holiday destinations was called Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 21 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Post@@ cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ vo@@ .com has been viewed for more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online people could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after the publication on the website .
travellers bar@@ gain over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some resol@@ ute travellers on foot who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street called Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came last night , probably more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my congreg@@ ations if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the other side of the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will come from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is being renovated and is scheduled to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost every year and also income through the local tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house back then .
he was to keep right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els Group , with its Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary au@@ c@@ tioning in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof farmers have been waiting for a long time in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up , explains sh@@ ear@@ ers further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
in demand for investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to precisely define himself .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the public by the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special En@@ counter sets out Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller shall have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Panel noted the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relying on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified its investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already first dischar@@ ges of the body in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been bl@@ aming the Krem@@ lin for a long time in order to have purpos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump@@ ur campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation should focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more sl@@ umps in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved to the center and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jury is therefore also called the defend@@ ant .
most of the time they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body can also be switched on by the prosecution in order to invite people to take part under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to CN@@ N , invitations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to testify , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , also Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the setting show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end in order to decide on the charge of an indictment .
nevertheless , the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the history of Russia is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject gives the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it continued in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been deployed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him for an attitude of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent promot@@ er of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Justice Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed .
Antar@@ ctic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg moves in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ haven of Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and would probably need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger to people doesn &apos;t go out from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the break @-@ off of the ic@@ e@@ berg has been unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ ferences of s@@ nu@@ gg@@ ly in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken pist@@ ol has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ b .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
consequently , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sho@@ es @-@ Hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece breaks out at a key location .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ sla@@ va is the fourth biggest s@@ nail of Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will be growing again or in the long run and possibly come together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the decline of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ic@@ eber@@ gs of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ integrated in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the polar area of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to this decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and t@@ olls to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U challenges the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k day saw 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them .
the courses in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be distributed this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demands for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
so high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Nations , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party .
he took care of a bad surprise already in the chal@@ k day when he publicly challenged the labour costs and amazed the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all opportunities to be reviewed which allow ex@@ iting from the communal employer association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim at a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better by the employees and officials when it is actually envis@@ aged by the public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of NGO migrants &apos; rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that his crew will take aboard ding@@ h@@ y migrants , which are delivered directly from the traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first of all have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations took place in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan civil masters this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
climbs and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the guard and wine festival at Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day I went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the view point at the viewpoint , connected with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents , was again on the look@@ out spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers gathered healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group got to know the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best site - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gears up for e @-@ sports
in the future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than fighting through the stadium spe@@ ar during wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also identified the first federal league clubs that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game in mid @-@ July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that several clubs go up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers compete against each other in different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualify .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer any markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia .
what is it all about ?
during e @-@ sport , computer games such as League of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup take place at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the Asian Games 20@@ 22 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many people the idea is certainly getting used to .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ arten has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction to reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also poses problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , a total of 50 million Euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
this is little against the 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te Consul@@ tant .
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ rob@@ arten . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing old times is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company to the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says de@@ bris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only in football everything is as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed downward , when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she fully regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not spend the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and like me with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to challenge another , commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , keep yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks prior to his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is shut down the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the event by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ my of the FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern takes a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that was Joshua k@@ im@@ me immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ em and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his tie to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could suggest Kim@@ i as well .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was born from youth games , de@@ but@@ ants , and especially from vacation , but he .
sugar l is best distributed to those you want to eat a lot that you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who have been chosen to meet Lah@@ em &apos;s heritage can use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ t over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
to the right of the back , that is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ mich took part in this starting formation , like the one who can best take the ru@@ dder into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ finished trou@@ pe .
he had the view of the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
V@@ idal there@@ with his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ ly hard ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out of the services of the Asia trip ( fol@@ ly also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver therefore , in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ cot are not negative .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ ver ran beside Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a few times successfully also in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the way we hoped &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance on the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; relo@@ cation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in connection with the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good @-@ bye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy tunes in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ ver an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win each game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on a change in economic policy on the basis of a change in economic policy - and at the same time re@@ charge the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the desires of the economy that has blocked le@@ m@@ ke together . &quot;
the biggest about @-@ turn sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 the construction law is to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokesman Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
as was suggested by Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports falling for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier believes in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 euros for the passed master test and 2500 euros is planned for graduates to become independent within ten years of their master training .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier , he said , &quot; We need to make quick facts about the planned road construction .
up to now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to recru@@ it mobility at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 in the maintenance of country roads as proposed .
Frank nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ outs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months due to in@@ consisten@@ cies , she already cleared the field .
Audi will change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW President said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ backs .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des emit@@ ting diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of viol@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
several employees of Volkswagen were indic@@ ted in the United States , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the test could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who pass the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a bad raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building paper wants to clear up .
on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the start of a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los B@@ ases and Lau@@ ghter Against The P@@ ain
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his characters are his trademark .
the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film with 85 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made the breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo characters ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find its dro@@ ll pieces worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened with climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the disease @-@ causing insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ic@@ cade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that tran@@ sm@@ its the d@@ warf ad , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the village of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .
the festival is held on Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ ants or a landing camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of government or car@@ tels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 .
among the latter is the publisher and its inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders who are connected with drug trafficking and organized crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting , and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
the S@@ agit@@ tari@@ us drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
in February there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tel fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presumably aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting examinations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led them .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task you think as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team measures Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for the routine of his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their cover@@ t run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells incorrect , stay away from it .
the anger is , the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the j@@ est , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trusted by the governor .
it is months since the re@@ porters went into the mountain landscape where the drugs gangs are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has stum@@ bled on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a pos@@ é of public spending concentrating on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that went through one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months earlier , readers would have looked at Val@@ dez column as the best informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few characters and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor the next morning because of another journalist .
Salvador ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become stronger throughout the country by written down on walking trails and buildings in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and bringing them to death because they said the truth .
since then , she has been asked to be re @-@ elected by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , involved government officials and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ decent society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their dis@@ crete head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as obviously the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began hum@@ ming .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with her@@ nia riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kar@@ tell messages in the region .
from the edge of the cur@@ b , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez raised a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were willing .
if they were scared at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a sc@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers that describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost think that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ burial , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better interfere in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its base .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs are hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals who use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intest@@ ines in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just ke@@ el a little bit with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when gigantic ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the reserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ de from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was washed ash@@ ore by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the house cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a winning in lot@@ to .
the more I watch it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ nants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread up .
I can count the scales at his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
serious accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles of traffic jam and coffee .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , around 17.@@ 00 hrs there were almost 30 cars between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , among them probably also trucks .
at first , no information was given above the exact number of the wounded .
it was a matter of moderate to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a round of about ten kilometres was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - by a number of G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire department noted the car drivers license plates , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing susp@@ icious is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just an ingenious thought .
and then : mu@@ ff@@ f .
if the conductor comes and w@@ akes one of us or breaks the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
card control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by phone that you occupy your place and vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently underway on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available at many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already done by most passengers anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you enter the train , call his ticket in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ dant will get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat Y booked .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at room Y during the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn uses the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel back without a ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you often go by train , you know that in addition to delays and missed features , ticket inspections are among the biggest stum@@ bling blocks .
because often , in any case , however , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed for the validation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , resulting in a bad atmosphere in the compartment or greater space and delays in the control of one &apos;s ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo . , live .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she was watching a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his rif@@ le and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11th .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , carrying a flower dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ uson , the two talked a conversation , which they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community who prof@@ ited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are presented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets are showing surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos; life , as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ izing of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells tells the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager , Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , have marked the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social media , identified themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not by chance even though it was on the front line , because in a life at these cross@@ roads as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the message cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct sp@@ li@@ ts the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say a bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schu@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the remaining stores profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction phase there will be an end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to the Bed@@ a @-@ Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady again and again very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why purchasing palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there are already plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall stays intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is also cheap .
as you can see , stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the rented rental is often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where is the farmer &apos;s market going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes out sometime .
or does the spec@@ tra@@ l bit gallery already manage to exp@@ el all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but there is no room for a farmer &apos;s market thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
once the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public @-@ classified diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ former and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was tran@@ sm@@ uted by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ gard has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her adol@@ escence , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ chers and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ gard at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use were transformed into un@@ equal bridges that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lied Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was published , would demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome form of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump brings a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid sp@@ li@@ ts that he should actually solve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ gard was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing challenged with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
with the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ free speech on the hands of the disciplinary ci@@ st@@ erns of the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they keep your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ gard of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford in search of murder
a nation @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County Court of Appe@@ al show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police actively search for the two susp@@ ects , said function@@ aries .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ oud , Vice President of University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them was now in absence and was excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said C@@ eb@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to prove himself .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Association , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious hint that said something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza has issued an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integrating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren of alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the matter of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ oh &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems in the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has decided to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was banned in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping scandal of WA@@ DA from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to be lucky with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s didn &apos;t work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the alert to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , to offer special groups and demo@@ graphics groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to track your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure staff engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Financial Innovation Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion has seized regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds that its employees are poorly treated or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , managing the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find investors with the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who supported both Start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
g@@ lit@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and secured his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are worth , and that the work you do pays off to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience for Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 ideas , you have to be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , has been able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it is hoped that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain themselves on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the water @-@ man football center the next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six seasons in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change in control , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ed@@ on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really gets really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task given the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been cleared with foot@@ balls .
fry players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third party fak@@ ers and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts inspection will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sarah S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says f@@ oul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter , written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated my welcome hole &quot; ) this seems to be too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landsc@@ aping , gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge on a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Pe@@ as@@ ant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an uprising that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portrayed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a stranger , always paying debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ lords . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all@@ uring promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is standing in competition with other communities .
in a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
the talks took place under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State as well as the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
this resulted in the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS .
the government is pulling the reign@@ s in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the navy have been dismissed .
since the coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired up 16@@ 9 gener@@ als and admir@@ als in 16@@ 9 .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the clin@@ ker of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gi@@ ve@@ away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article titled &quot; Un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff , there are concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the ban on soldiers for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale building in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing another 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as a gu@@ ardian of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least of appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically driving an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance for the pur@@ gations of the prepar@@ edness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump said , cited by the media .
it proposes to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spent on green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate road for motor@@ sport shuttle
over and over again over the past few months over the future of the race platform has been cont@@ ested - now it should go very quickly .
even before the end of the year is to be built on the ailing route on which the tourist train drives .
in order to secure the long @-@ term safety of the race platform , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works will begin in the course of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of re@@ pairing the route was about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country re@@ covers 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future , will be voted defini@@ tively , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle in December 2017 should be ordered on a regular basis .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested over the past few months whether the route is used by enough people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very ob@@ tru@@ sive in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it could not be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes indeed .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Stiftung für Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their climb seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would make a st@@ eppe woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : conflic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most .
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compared to a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex@@ ist .
their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they remain at the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the expression of 2017 : maid service
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy sense of human being
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions which the US voters have pol@@ arized also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of sl@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they had fought for decades on account of politics suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
around the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is noticeable in another context that this also involves considerable risks .
the Left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ty possibility that one day his kit@@ tens will no longer be expelled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself falling away from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are qu@@ aking and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the air @-@ changing music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as two two @-@ year old , an 11 year old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the assessment with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to slow@@ ing down what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ essively gra@@ c@@ efully , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his hand joints , according to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first killing spre@@ ader for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ foot@@ men from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the school holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and public representatives in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , the lively band played a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hat@@ ched from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young guns carrying the cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished for each quad@@ ru@@ ple that he felt accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a letter of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to subordin@@ ate passes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the time of the coast is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years of lessons , because it had been a really great time .
finally she can rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äss@@ ler .
finally , all students ended a song of summer time and vacation time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal refugees was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and provide anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the inspections are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission performance of cars of the emission ticket Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates before are valid only for the vehicles that have the che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power drive federal office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler told us to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework .
how long will the conversion work ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
they depend on the commitment of the producers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who don &apos;t drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will take part in the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has therefore announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he con@@ veys in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es that no application has yet been submitted to the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for famili@@ ar@@ isation with regard to the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach is responsible for the management community as a lower construction law authority , the applicant must present corresponding statements .
because this function does not want to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the city and it is important to the citizens , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the field of pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life @-@ worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ platz have also been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will book with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great scope for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and garden nursery , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historical monument , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is in tune , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going cit@@ y@@ maker emphasizes .
anyway , the master builder bears a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs above my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , you should be able to present a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or b@@ achel@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law .
the municipal construction department is subject to high and civil engineering , building instruction planning , ground advertising opportunities , municipal utility buildings , urban depot with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as sub@@ urban building rights authorities , including historic preservation .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators brought the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and search for them since the night hours .
near the scene there were witnessed by witnesses a sco@@ oter and a bike rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a native of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he or the wrong@@ do@@ ers would have put themselves in great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of late and the costs for rail replacement transport , the railway customers could also get to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum could be assumed , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern route could be disabled without disability .
just under ten passenger trains took off Friday morning , two of which were concerned with correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ redness .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering infections are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to show that a type of tolerance fo@@ stering immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet intoler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus , if the same system works with people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that fo@@ stered the tolerance when it found out that a group of mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately housed , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ cos@@ m of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them missing in the mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they did not have an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria were immune to the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same intoler@@ ance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us have L. rep@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid ki@@ cked off on Tuesday and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues had been excluded and only lasted 45 minutes , giving M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u star@@ ed at the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclosed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three other new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such an advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , however : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
there was no counter @-@ wind from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League - that was the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with the head@@ wind .
there were deep set@@ backs .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably ruled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president Stephen Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faction of Green Party MPs into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the country , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party CEO Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ jackets to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accession to the CD@@ U means a clear understanding of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign leader of the Gre@@ ens to the Germany editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner sigh@@ s when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is following the accession of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD country associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades cal@@ med down at the time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and that became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the SPD lost its defeat in Kiel , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cut off the party smoothly .
in the weeks after that , the comrades lab@@ elled again lab@@ ori@@ ously .
then , when they had just got new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in the crisis communication afterwards , what can be done wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ te Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government for the past few weeks .
the ambi@@ tions of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they let him grant him , as they promised by Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not at the fault of the internal party of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony .
and Schulz doesn &apos;t know at all .
for the time being , comrades , comrades , try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the stub@@ born Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ jackets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen puts her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ jackets was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years will soon be able to get support from the country .
on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives took part in urban development on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler had once again given a review of what was happening .
since 1991 , there are rehabilitation areas in sensi@@ cal areas .
back then , in the re@@ development area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the present refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is finally important to also promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the sum total amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest from the community &apos;s sensi@@ bilities .
how is a re@@ development area created now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Sch@@ ind@@ ler will continue to examine where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabili@@ tate .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working relationships and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot , carried out .
the re@@ development area would then finally be defined as a sentence .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding is exp@@ ended from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking could only be carried out , within the framework of which the participants in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the statutes are to be taken as soon as possible , so that the restoration can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned Vor@@ ab tests .
the aim is to evaluate the conditions of the urban development and decide when it is rehabili@@ t@@ ated and to what extent .
there will also be a refur@@ bish@@ ment note in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ bilities and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it deals , among other things , the structural condition and the refur@@ bish@@ ment views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hou@@ se@@ - and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be completed if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of funds is functioning according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , advises first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve funds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sett@@ les himself a micro@@ chip in order to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed Z@@ 4 technology both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , which was left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man of Wis@@ con@@ sin and a fork @-@ lift truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the chron@@ icle of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation .
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and so long remained until the lawn became vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was necessary .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we posed was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents shall be obliged to use them for the journey .
but to demand their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to susp@@ end U.S. pres@@ idents in the White House with precision centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokesman of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week items produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tricky task
the championship leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga comes to the stand@@ ings in the third party of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 : 00 in Kiel , Germany , at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis Championships got the sense of the reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior pole positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports from the high north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sey ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us as ever . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is practically .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ chman is not currently playing the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for his first use during this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ en@@ Hans Pod@@ pse @-@ Cas@@ tillo , with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should also be present in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins against the club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also return to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the coaching staff asks Mari@@ us Z@@ ay to fill the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV are worried that together with other European companies the construction of the Russian Baltic sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 is co @-@ financed .
the sound of the dr@@ one is enormous .
however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump had to bring the sanctions to life even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be the focus of the series from Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the squ@@ ads three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one got their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the car@@ tel , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the new trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry Da@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself again .
with firm contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is continued in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh tea .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last year of the year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children , who are cared for in 45 days of the week , are at lunch in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 participants from 1 September have kitchen service : they heat up the meals delivered , add salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give off , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven group@@ ing facilities - decide on the hour &apos;s circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important to the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical for the city as the most economical one , it means from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at around 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afgh@@ an independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production in its Glasgow factory by managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company weighed over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ a location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea biscuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties &apos;s owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than £ 5 million in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s head office , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; express concerns that funding for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
one of the spokes@@ woman of Plat@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ a just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our cross @-@ country location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ a as a production plant entirely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the prospect of the PS@@ G three years ago ?
when Manchester City was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer express interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oters are tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator has deliberately dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and thus inflic@@ ted material damage of more than 200 euros at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
police witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to avoid a car in his lane and tou@@ red the guard rail at the same time .
on Thursday evening , the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ yp@@ assing of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
on the passenger car , material damage was created .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident , it can be good that the mar@@ l driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident and the driver of the judgment vehicle to contact the Stol@@ zen@@ au police station at Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche &quot; ( Church of the Reformation ) , after publication in front of the German Press Agency , he was expecting an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then incorrect evaluation of the events .
the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , it was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a dev@@ ouring fire . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows were a normal pedago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for decades as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger recorded the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks of 67 domain cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
however , contrary to many other defend@@ ants , many of the victims often under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even bring positive memories to him in spite of violence . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal caused by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Non @-@ Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more man@@ a@@ geable when a domain set had no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as being a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he is particularly dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
at best , one can repro@@ ach him , to know it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which it worked was felt by virtually all sur@@ vey@@ ed as - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also provide an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotional appeal , which also led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he was not only cra@@ mmed with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also made ear@@ heads distributed and too che@@ ek@@ y guys went to the hair or ears , he already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ olog@@ ised for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it is not more about his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just over@@ threw him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported on the subject of abuse at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted to the Master Cap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely information and could have stopped the perpet@@ rator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ben are more intru@@ sive and clearer or even more open than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , confidence teachers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
he cannot be accused either of preventing him or having brought him to an advertisement .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
however , this is exactly the abuse of the report .
there is a clear separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and ex@@ cre@@ tion of violence as well as , we once say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally sho@@ ved and painted and suffered from them , all of them suffered from the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ sp@@ ar gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories connect with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school he didn &apos;t work and was responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ cat @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test fin@@ es were long banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows .
it was also difficult for him to assess where the people affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
that &apos;s just not right .
only in 1980 the penalty for schools in Bavaria was officially aboli@@ shed .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ kn@@ it of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right there .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what was done in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s pra@@ w@@ ns , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take shelter , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so ear@@ ne@@ stly and in the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test sentence also come to speech ?
Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , therefore Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells us from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen just played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world tran@@ g institution until then , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and can@@ dies alone , one does not make a big singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced a wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good person , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could even do something a fly .
I regularly receive with , how many former dom@@ esti@@ cks still today , 23 years after his appointment , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who don &apos;t forgive him until today , that he was once stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , of course , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to which they are still looking up and which they almost rever@@ e .
and please , once again quite clear : everything you acc@@ use to it are educational methods that were on the agenda back then .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the stand @-@ up , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would probably not know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) would finally be in peace .
