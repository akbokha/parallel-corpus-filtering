<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - yet very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called Ursus sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops came off with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph further strengthened the project, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The submission sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller-part card appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered copies from the so-called "Urbs" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels now show no farmers there - but small farmers in the plant "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people at the Salesianum in Munich meet on the grounds of the former prison hospital.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the soccer field of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenberg, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered by 1856 as the" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufinger Street was named" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 will be the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn's regular circuit.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes Missouri Travel warning</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, requires special attention from afro-American travellers, visitors and Missouri, since a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and can be noted here," "" "says the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently-approved Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination and prosecuting authorities of the state that disproportionately aim at minorities, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office that shows that black motorists are 75 percent more common in the state than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring some deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri reported 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI report of the FBI, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, following the adoption of immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations which will contribute to further racial prospecting in the view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "electric fence project is elementary" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Weidewitn" "" "project is a successful project and will be continued next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac received a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies in the administrative court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insight into his operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketing path for him for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also the chairman of the" "" "Fisherbach" "", "he described the electric fence project as" "" "elementary important." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot generate profit on such steep grounds." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much need to be edited with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over his parental operation and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead organic farming.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader's promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and worrying about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of open space is 40 hectares, which cannot be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were encouraged, a quarter contributed to the community of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women in the countryside." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of fencing fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced off may not be economically viable (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "for the" "" "fisher" "" "electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for a drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller grabbed the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-insulators would have learned it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he picked up its significance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta cried: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is technically correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time in which the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the US Trumpet.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves up to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not to light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh came across quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great fanciful deed was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is the true sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue is speaking to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to light the way, but the hatred, which is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union thus sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>

<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and to play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">This is why the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical Columnists and to arrest or silence protesters.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 per cent said they were belatedly discovered that they were mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey was carried out with more than 1,000 people - driven by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., - also found that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of those surveyed who stated that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk reveals another, less brilliant figure for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car whose delivery has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 of such noncommittal reservations envisage, musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge of the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models should be combined - 500,000, by 2020, one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a Model 3 today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines ever tested in practice with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="440">A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change, when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is a deadline that was running on 1st October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay his compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal return for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methanlecks.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often not met the deadlines for the implementation and then waited to be accused by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to establish an appointment for the implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius site is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters tumbling to their request.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wuerttemberg Documentary Book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the tumble hill outside the former parish church there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or the patronage was owned and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858 it was adjacent to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the beautiful settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the time around the year 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was born from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was wrecked at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed down during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard was also the last resting place for the dead from hearers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilary Church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the bell tower and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-werg which is still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kentiberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffy Rentals" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn are the Hilarius machines.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organiser, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery in St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo des Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann's name is the closing word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30 a.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the forest," "" "the organisers show up the fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade happens only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of great importance for Tumours and hearers.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to homeland care, such as Serenade organizer Walter Martini.</seg>

<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the Furniture Fair, once a week, I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked in the open whole day at the school.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, therefore a late-born volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Question: I did a high school diploma.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully demolished.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it's a wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, in the focal point maybe also, really.</seg>

<seg id="698">In the winter semester, I will start my studies in the social system.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut down its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job cuts, which General Director John Fallon announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 points have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May, Pearson announced a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.</seg>

<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there was at least 1,662 civilian fatalities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack in the country, since the US-led troops pushed the Taliban back from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>

<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering over such a common area not as a meeting point for the residents of the just living, but openly into the community.</seg>

<seg id="759">The proposed resolution is to signal the investor that he does not want to throw billets between the legs in this respect, the statement that both saddle and pitch roof - which reduces the pitch height and makes the building more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer means this addition.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: it is in tune with the body.</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, whereas in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is" "" "possibly under 18 years old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "he said to The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases suggesting that the underestimated person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigates the 581 published results, she realized that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>

<seg id="918">This is a marginal fortification, which is also used as operating distance.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 meter wide bridge crane is to be used on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1092">Mr Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs-Chargen.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs are out of supply - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?</seg>

<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the dismay of Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1102">If the residual oil content of eggs exceeds 0,005mg / kg, these are not marketable.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unloaded eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time the factories are not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to the current state of knowledge, production plants do not have immediate guilt.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues from the European football clubs will not disturb Neymars's world record transfers from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, as the guiding organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid €222 million ($262 million) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can secure the money with security so that Neymar writes and brings him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruler of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply a lot of money to buy players, but they have to counteract legitimate income sources that enable them to break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was disgraced by the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to shy away from excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly intensify the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG purchased the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the plan of selling prices for the next five years can be indicated in the amount of €44.4m in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, located in the possession of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of Neymar's PSG payments could be made via payments from the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatari 2022 deny that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators to be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to avoid any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with sales of €542.4 million has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper article, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract beyond the spring of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the excourses are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lower lip of "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random insanity that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang as she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now evokes a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring-combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It's a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching chess on TV, as Americans perhaps do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde the voice out'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," who was edited for a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick males who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former owner with a passion for real estate, settled in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne closet space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down through the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulins lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all joys and jars of joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumpet's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame junk by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumpet's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February facing Polico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep the slump Twitter habit under control is to make sure that his personal media consumption entails a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumpet's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about - that Trumpet Tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed to keep his anger away from him several times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented it from creating trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">One part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that might promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to give the president for strategic reasons dubious information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out where they originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone unwillingly accused the president of a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief-staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has voiced her.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisers are still striving for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump had personally moved to the center and undertook the accusation whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "the history of Russia is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1521">The Koloss, weighing over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and would probably need two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger to people doesn't go out from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-off of the iceberg has been unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual interferences of snuggly in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken pistol has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelslab.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">Consequently, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Shoes-Horseshoe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete horseshoe there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can crumble if a piece breaks out at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow straight into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelslava is the fourth biggest snail of Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists is disputed whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will be growing again or in the long run and possibly come together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead the decline of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many icebergs of the Antarctic Peninsula have been disintegrated in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the polar area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to this decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and tolls to the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU challenges the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the chalk day saw 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The courses in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be distributed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demands for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This results in a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So high time for action so that not even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Nations, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common motion with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He took care of a bad surprise already in the chalk day when he publicly challenged the labour costs and amazed the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all opportunities to be reviewed which allow exiting from the communal employer association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim at a hourly rate," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay better by the employees and officials when it is actually envisaged by the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO migrants' rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian coastguards, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must first of all have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations took place in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many people the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Even Ingo Frobarten has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as callbacks.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The costs of car manufacturers, systems for neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of violating the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-causing insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small iccade, a micro-bacterium that transmits the dwarf ad, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is the publisher and its inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hung on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Federal Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders who are connected with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting, and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot in Sinaloa or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, presumably aisle members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting examinations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team measures Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for the routine of his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells incorrect, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the jest, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trusted by the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape where the drugs gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has stumbled on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a posé of public spending concentrating on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that went through one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few characters and went to the office of the prosecutor the next morning because of another journalist.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and bringing them to death because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then, she has been asked to be re-elected by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better interfere in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>

<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that dinosaurs are hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestines in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea floor.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protrude from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was washed ashore by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the house cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, around 17.00 hrs there were almost 30 cars between the outlets Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, among them probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first, no information was given above the exact number of the wounded.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a matter of moderate to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>

<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at room Y during the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep quiet.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn uses the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2012">If you often go by train, you know that in addition to delays and missed features, ticket inspections are among the biggest stumbling blocks.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, however, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed for the validation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, resulting in a bad atmosphere in the compartment or greater space and delays in the control of one's ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, carrying a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation, which they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism totally changed after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the remaining stores profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer's market stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction phase there will be an end.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is also cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the rented rental is often not portable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't suit me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">First of all: where is the farmer's market going to be during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes out sometime.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits of Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after making public-classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transformer and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transmuted by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Haggard has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only in the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her adolescence, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits comfortably on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butchers and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Haggard at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were transformed into unequal bridges that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Supplied Images" "" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition in person." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome form of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump brings a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid splits that he should actually solve.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Haggard was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning challenged with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">With the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she appears with a hands-free speech on the hands of the disciplinary cisterns of the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they keep your speech cold, then they have won," "" "it says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while police actively search for the two suspects, said functionaries.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cuboud, Vice President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now in absence and was excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "said Cebbage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"" "a spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that" "" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to prove himself.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Association, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious hint that said something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza has issued an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>
<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future" "" "- Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," "" "concluded Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for reintegrating RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything has been announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren of alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "on the matter of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit that which does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutoh's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems in the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has decided to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was banned in November 2015 as part of the Doping scandal of WADA from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>
<seg id="2197">After a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be used again.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to be lucky with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is at the alert to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, to offer special groups and demographics groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure staff engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat-card of the company that shows which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post which describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Innovation Website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As GLINT, Convercent companies can send customised "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline where employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints proceed directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion has seized regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds that its employees are poorly treated or behave ethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster - like discrimination, harassment or unfair internship.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, managing the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that businesses realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent provide your software as a service, and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find investors with the approval of Venture Capital Investors who supported both Start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and secured his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are worth, and that the work you do pays off to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience for LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 ideas, you have to be prepared to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, has been able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it is hoped that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11pm when a lot of UCLA footballers entertain themselves on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled out their tricot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these idle minutes are a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before they return to the water-man football center the next morning at 6: 30.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the guys next three days," "" "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. in order to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras, six seasons in Westwood performed practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal play preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Mora said that he supports NCAA's change in control, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2270">"" "" "" "we put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," "" "said Mora." ""</seg>

<seg id="2283">Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false notifications to third party fakers and display their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. it is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.</seg>
<seg id="2284">The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false notifications and send them to factual reviews that may display results of the fact test from the original article.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="2286">The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled posts like before the elections there in September.</seg>
<seg id="2287">On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts inspection will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and now has become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says foul." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"" "" "" "what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages through to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac handiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter, written by a double agent in the 1700" s, who worked for the Jacobins, "" "" he says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb-print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were also there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a little overrated my welcome hole") this seems to be too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the assembled hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and started to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps showing what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge on a broader base into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uprising that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "the uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start." ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "maybe the two are interconnected?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a stranger, always paying debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford." ""</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men redeemed their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to recruit landlords. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his deployment in the castle Rhodes is searching for other unique write experiences</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The talks took place under the chairmanship of the Heads of State as well as the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This resulted in the number of civilians in the YAS.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reigns in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the air forces and the navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup, President Erdogan has fired up 169 generals and admirals in 169.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the clinker of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">"" "already on the day after the coup, Erdogan described the coup attempt as a" "" "giveaway" "" "as he gave him the opportunity to" "" "clean up the armed forces" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the "Hürriyet" newspaper published an article titled "Unpleasantness in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff, there are concerns about increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the repeal of the ban on soldiers for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale building in the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was firing another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stiftung für Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their climb seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "who would make a steppe woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (means: conflicting) Farrah, restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy compared to a vibrator on his website, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" "" "it is said on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sexist.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they remain at the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expression of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy sense of human being</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump-era that the political divisions which the US voters have polarized also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all reportedly exert ourselves to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of slumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity could have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they had fought for decades on account of politics suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it is noticeable in another context that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The Left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "trump" "", "we refer to the cruelty possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be expelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling away from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact appear to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are quaking and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the air-changing music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two two-year old, an 11 year old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the assessment with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to slowing down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood excessively gracefully, while I wearied the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius relocated to hospital with chest pain</seg>

<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "Pistorius was convicted of a first killing spreader for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Law Enforcement Administration said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of him smashed, the eagles spread his wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a hen dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young guns carrying the cylinders to make the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, it amazes that no application has yet been submitted to the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time for familiarisation with regard to the regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is responsible for the management community as a lower construction law authority, the applicant must present corresponding statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function does not want to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the city and it is important to the citizens, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "one can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town as an ensemble is listed as a historical monument, it is important to "have an eye on what is in tune," when new buildings are approved, the outgoing citymaker emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the master builder bears a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "in the end everything runs above my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2563">If you want to be buried by Roland Wacker, you should be able to present a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering infections are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to show that a type of tolerance fostering immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet intolerant to tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that fostered the tolerance when it found out that a group of mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately housed, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microcosm of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in the mice with the immune cells but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they did not have an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria were immune to the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same intolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us have L. repteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their house in the years will soon be able to get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives took part in urban development on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler had once again given a review of what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there are rehabilitation areas in sensical areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the redevelopment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsidy was at least 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the present refurbishments are a "achievement project" - it is finally important to also promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum total amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest from the community's sensibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a redevelopment area created now?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "so Schindler will continue to examine where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovations would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working relationships and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot, carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then finally be defined as a sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The eligibility period for the funding is expended from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the stocktaking could only be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the refurbishment area receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statutes are to be taken as soon as possible, so that the restoration can begin in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every Commune had to carry out the aforementioned Vorab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate the conditions of the urban development and decide when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a refurbishment note in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to sensibilities and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">"" "" "" "a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>

<seg id="2702">However, it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche" (Church of the Reformation), after publication in front of the German Press Agency, he was expecting an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect evaluation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen, it was measured with "double standards."</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that "shameful and shameful acts" would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we like to go to the church and this is a devouring fire."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows were a normal pedagogical tool" "", "" "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for decades as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger recorded the "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks of 67 domain cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, contrary to many other defendants, many of the victims often underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even bring positive memories to him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal caused by the Regensburger Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger, is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Non-Violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen," "" "gives a contradictory picture of George Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became more manageable when a domain set had no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as being a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael hesemann: if you take the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is particularly dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the preschool expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, to know it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "" "on which it worked was felt by virtually all surveyed as - literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also provide an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm hearted," "sincere," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional appeal, which also led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he was not only crammed with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also made earheads distributed and too cheeky guys went to the hair or ears, he already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excretion of violence at the preschool, these are admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more about his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just overthrew him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported on the subject of abuse at the Domspatzen (Regensburger Domspatzen).</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the Master Capellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role with regard to misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely information and could have stopped the perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that out of it... Buben are more intrusive and clearer or even more open than towards their parents, dormitory leaders, confidence teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused either of preventing him or having brought him to an advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "excesses" "" "was to be read by the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former master master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">However, this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clear separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excretion of violence as well as, we once say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were literally shoved and painted and suffered from them, all of them suffered from the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the cathedral-spar gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, as most witnesses emphasise, the subject" "" "primary school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">They were only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories connect with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and from the events at a school he didn't work and was responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-cat-gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the preschool the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test fines were long banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to assess where the people affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the penalty for schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "fallknit of anachronism" "", "so the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and also not for what was done in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's prawns, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take shelter, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so earnestly and in the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, therefore Pope Benedict XVI, tells us from his perspective, that the Domspatzen just played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world trang institution until then, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candies alone, one does not make a big singer from rebellious boys and stand before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good person, of whom you can't imagine that he could even do something a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive with, how many former domesticks still today, 23 years after his appointment, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who don't forgive him until today, that he was once stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen today are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to which they are still looking up and which they almost revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: everything you accuse to it are educational methods that were on the agenda back then.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the scapegoat.</seg>
