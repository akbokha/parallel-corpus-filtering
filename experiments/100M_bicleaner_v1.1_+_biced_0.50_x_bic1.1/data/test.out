28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , shared the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations were underway .
the victim , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who formerly worked as Koch in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a admitted that Frank lived in host@@ els initially , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to combine his way with his family was to cook us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , who lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is requested to call the related issue of the SF@@ PD under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label , which usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more snow@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of the television with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not need to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is no child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home to the for@@ age in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that ended the riding career again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself run with his family over the system of the AL@@ RV , he didn &apos;t even s@@ well for photo purposes on a horse .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Py@@ ramid of Sports .
there is no lack of awards to the li@@ ke@@ able athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting young people .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the featured are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
clin@@ tons and tr@@ umps economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s what Clinton and Tr@@ ump want .
however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idential Com@@ positions are , however , in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical difference .
that , about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in that respect , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic applicant even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state critical Te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
on Tr@@ ump , there could be some party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement hopes to termin@@ ate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - but also in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ffer trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , for example , for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what tr@@ ump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage must rise , and then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ minded women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs installed the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe e.V .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for escap@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many sne@@ e@@ ze away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that tu@@ gs are demanding sexual action for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , the end tells B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and at worst mis@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that about 90 percent of the women living in the housing in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they do not dare to talk openly about what they have experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t want to help themselves , more accommodations only need for them , requires B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their sphere of jurisdiction , some answer no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is no such thing as accommodations of the Govern@@ ments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some community shel@@ ters floors or own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women can be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated , there can be - continual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve been around for a long time , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily build a second house .
assistance doctors argue : demands for new combat measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant physicians have called their union to appro@@ ve new fighting measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more campaign measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
assistance doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , leading to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today filed a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work combat measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in assistance doctors at the age of six , the first general failure in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms of contract recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors and medical students , with the advantage that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced by force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be slo@@ ppy , and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something terrible had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was arous@@ ed .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the decline was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey seriously - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is angry towards the West , as it looks at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the au@@ ger pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara on the fact that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected state organs .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , which has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime changes .
the summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and feel bad and now unite .
nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents were told at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided addressing a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming more of a bench of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we have no global goals , but pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these stamps will stand in their own congreg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we concentrate within ( we asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career shoots
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enth@@ used by fans for years now .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have gotten 6.000 money if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Grand Tournam@@ ent jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered 30 years winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his least 5@@ 1st year of life .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence committee for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the staff and staff of the staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow secret .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest intimate Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president - would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin site , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entr@@ ust a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people to whom he trusted the most .
it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term of National Put@@ ins viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son was fired after he hit Produc@@ ers
last month Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced in a joint statement his resignation .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his resignation on Thursday .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son comes out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od inside the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a release published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .

ri@@ dd@@ les around Pis@@ ces , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be sand a@@ als in the 75 fish that were mirr@@ ored by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing Crossing Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach completion at each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck in their place and the last section of the deck is given a kick @-@ off for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and low @-@ rise buildings .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , tiny - on each side they only ru@@ d@@ ded a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble floating in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have blown the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing vessel , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has watched over these men today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
badly injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ free perpet@@ rator sm@@ ashed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by hand and in the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ rator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes he called his mother .
this al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old created his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors should be taken much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that over the next few years , Braunschweig is losing nearly 1300 affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the fight is inevitable .
first and foremost it concerns the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all flats as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the stocks .
however , the big issue in the town hall is , Brat@@ mann said , &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new housing development programme that will cost millions and will still have to be financed should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left will still impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
not@@ withstanding that , Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
but the programme does not yet fully exist : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how to compensate for the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now buy @-@ out bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
because in the West Town , Fri@@ sten are running out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the residential construction companies .
because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased , one will be removed from the goal of the so @-@ called &quot; mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go on board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go out to play anymore , instead prefer to spend their free time on screens , has been depl@@ eted by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) .
like many Pop@@ ular phenomena , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ stores each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch App , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days of the market launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for performance enhancement .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; on deaf ears , because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people that look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always there are also m@@ ür@@ k playing fans , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished over time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt become more active , more fit and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s urine
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all of this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
all along the line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast inv@@ aded the competition title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American woman Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue Team said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign in@@ ale of women at the Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
a part of her floor exercises , which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass , is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ad in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gym where bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has no longer lost a competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina ran through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish beams and ground th@@ rows - in which it holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and placed another 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her en@@ der@@ ment - pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became a reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year old man capit@@ aine , called &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her ground exercise she threw the audience &apos;s kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in a car accident in a car accident
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the cul@@ pri@@ t fired eight shots from a portable fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police said that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y affair , since the attack@@ er didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge cases and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with cephal@@ ic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his age @-@ mates Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t .
I don &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first response to this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him drawing language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says she . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the a@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency exit on Friday . it is reck@@ oned with more rain@@ falls on the whole Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National weather service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river A@@ mite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many houses nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow through the rivers of Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded on Friday .
rescue teams still associated people from flood water in the districts A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ be .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and f@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife , Hans@@ ford , said that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer reported a 13.@@ 75 @-@ inch rain near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground was considerably sur@@ fed by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded .
the Chief of the Church Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the flood .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed because of the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rush of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his details , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday there were not reported until now .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun@@ shot injuries , including lung , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital for transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that it is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether it could be under one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
assault rif@@ les for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ took the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly a sustained struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , they were station@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently audi@@ ting reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross@@ bar in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine doing at the Women &apos;s Olympics in gymnas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been there at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Katho@@ lik@@ in , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one of the female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America ju@@ bil@@ ant .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see gym@@ n@@ astic classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ n@@ astic primarily in private gym@@ n@@ astic clubs , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gym@@ n@@ astic and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both her athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the communities au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy to access turn training .
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ mes of the Olympic team gold and thank you , ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organise other strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance doctors who voted in favour of a vote refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful for the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend contributions so as to improve the maintenance at irregular hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance doctors said last night in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors are still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and treat it to treat all the doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks have prompted the government to take part in opposition and sometimes silence the de@@ af@@ ening silence .
it happened that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise awareness and address the worries of assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he fail to do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors in the cket line .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Con@@ tract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , director general of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fighting measures do not achieve anything of the only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , emergency and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training programs , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observ@@ ance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medication after advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the ar@@ tery walls that make plaque build .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that stops the flow of blood up to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots release , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Insurance Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness raises election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from the office
a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now a corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of elec@@ tors from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of electoral cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should conduct an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity at elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er has to call his name and address .
the report proposes to put non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they release their votes in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let election scandal in eastern London .
last year , a special arbit@@ ration court ruled that the acting mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ent@@ less duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself in particular alar@@ ming the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose candidates of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding signs to prove identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence it was indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists work let@@ tering papers to stop &quot; election re@@ aps . &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
don &apos;t use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of a person &apos;s nationality should be carried out to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on requests for an automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban that political activists edit full postal elections and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ box . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers to electoral jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law which makes an accus@@ ation much easier due to in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule that voters are going alone in the voting booth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that no criminal complaint was made after the Tower Ham@@ let affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ points &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
mad after K@@ ath Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive dual companion of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic ic@@ ill@@ in is by far not the only athlete that has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ques that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : crew member of the US squ@@ ad Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ath &apos;s double @-@ passing rider on the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ery could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy said to the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is meant to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the lee star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
another ongoing comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal race Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , U.S. football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile resem@@ bling Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers went off &quot; as usual &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was switched off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming crowd .
Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ u@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadian Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language .
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ u@@ han in China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s cri@@ tique on Twitter came fast and hard , many of which made him talk
Twitter users didn &apos;t hold back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .

shortly after Scott Russ@@ el compla@@ ined that the C@@ BC broadcast moder@@ ated , live for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance being broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate choice , we are sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times to the people who responded to the Noti@@ ce via Twitter
the comment holder Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our spectators on the programme and our followers in the social media .
to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ism , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ took under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyer did not know where to go , when a woman with@@ drew her clothes in the middle of a mark in order to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation she watched as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back on the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back to the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she moved back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room she took a pair of under@@ pants from the outside , pulled out their own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , attracted herself and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone - or think about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants they had tasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think someone would take home under@@ pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull out the clothes from sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out again and didn &apos;t wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place in our branch in Folk@@ stone on Tuesday , 9 August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it somewhat safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer around for your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the shot line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist , while the aggres@@ sor gri@@ ps with pain , the weapon from his hands . hit it with the barrel in the face and move backwards while directing the weapon to him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon from its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to hand over your money unless you are a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right che@@ es his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a guide
a British travel@@ er underwent a serious examination of his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k cut off his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before removing any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight .
the idea of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing button on a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily nothing left what he le@@ aned , more than a bad taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to flush @-@ but@@ ton@@ ing of toilets , the task of the immune system was definitely under a test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which refused to leak after their lumin@@ ometric rating exceeded 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things that I instructed him to lick up like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ port@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had pla@@ stered holes , wooden boards were pil@@ ed up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this estate is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash has been found
in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were pil@@ ed up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ on were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbors who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would have had to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step taking into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty water mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ cation .
workers in the property management will now have to sweep away rub@@ b@@ ish mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine @-@ sentence after having owed himself guilty to the holding of a class B drug in commercial sight .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ by who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say that they will navigate rent@@ ers who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall &apos;s police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces put an incredible crash
the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment when the frigh@@ tened tourist began to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun an@@ em@@ akers on the beach stage in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up , understand@@ ably , worried about the noise of the nozzle engines , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; twice really flew very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on airplane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats in front of the coast and to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew lower than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility of the surface area . however , the air forces insisted that safety was at no risk at all .
surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today gave the pilot that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with sor@@ rows against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new season of football .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ won is forced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish N@@ ey@@ mar with the defeated cup@@ in@@ alist and reign@@ ing European League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who is den@@ ying the Olympic So@@ ccer Tournam@@ ent with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a bend in the knee in the training , which at least clari@@ fied the interro@@ gation of Bar@@ ca for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique did not yet have a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen was the champion in most of the other applicants .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince .
in turn , the 2 : 3 defeat after an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid has di@@ gest@@ ed and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with eleven successes to date , Barcelona has been the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .
on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Cup first took the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time @-@ outs , they had no coaches .
they had retired to the grand@@ stand and left their guns on one another in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the match up to this place I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said ang@@ ri@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he determined the tempo on the plate and let Z@@ hang down as only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thrilling match .
but nevertheless , a sufficiently stunning ball change to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an advanced a tendency to rib@@ bed , was then in medical treatment , had to &quot; ultimately &quot; so@@ ber with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , became the Olympic @-@ Fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up &quot; tremendous problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns as well as in traditional conservative federal states lose their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ är , normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having cast 16 rival within the own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media coverage .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ le
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by far the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else but to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , Tr@@ ump has threatened to strike funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present a better survey .
instead of that , the Republi@@ cans &apos; candidates for Congress would be stronger than the arms .
Olympia : three @-@ dimensional sc@@ am at dop@@ ing @-@ test
the IO@@ C plans to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary reported that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson rot@@ i .
this was reported to the Team Princip@@ al of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the International Association of IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson said .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate , &quot; it was said in an IA@@ AF statement .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and , as F@@ erg@@ uson rot@@ i , issued and signed the trial , &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s Chief de Mission , Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
in 2015 F@@ erg@@ uson rot@@ ich became more than 800 meters in Beijing World Cup four @-@ fourth .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing associations .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio games , it was not unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA have taken Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly made that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in the Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that this kind of sport has been systematically de@@ activated in this sport .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ ather@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly , because it &apos;s musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be there .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is smart , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , joining the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death several weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had pre@@ disposed to leave the country @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from east of London asc@@ ended to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then embark@@ ed on a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow in a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory near Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Scotland &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority guide in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference on Thursday that Clinton is expecting him to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .

the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine was distingu@@ ishable from Old@@ school Play@@ boys as Play@@ boy was for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the depic@@ tion of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person with an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; those who do not care and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate Stiftung Dialog und Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of guards who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh judgment of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands in the medium term with a few hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with stra@@ de months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing in Turkey .
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving coup d &quot; é@@ tat , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state , which is accepting refugees itself , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the Association compla@@ ined about the targeted arrival of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this means that Erdo@@ gan is aiming to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Association called for the German government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not care and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ė@@ nas , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proxim@@ ate Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the World .
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set up the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey we do not find those before war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament voted in the beginning of the year .
after all , it is not so stupid as to date : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign champi@@ ons , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and to count voices at the end , only troubles@@ ome to apply .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again let election campaigns run short of the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition shelf .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little bit with the people , just as his legendary for@@ er@@ un@@ ner Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise soul @-@ ering has cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time .
she has invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to Groß@@ kund@@ geb@@ ungen ; Merkel &apos;s federal election district is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a pity no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U wai@@ ves the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to co@@ king , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , it crum@@ bles the base that it must be very strict to find a wire again to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last remained at 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday necessity and largely move their campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on search for domestic vocal ch@@ ords among vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ atures with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only end at 20 o &apos;clock , there is praise everywhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;ve done everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff says of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up homes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back again , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the transit through the village seems to be going back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable discomfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aks were looking and more familiar with their na@@ vi than the sign@@ posting .
what caused some trucks to be fran@@ c@@ ised in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community also called for ampli@@ fication of the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself very know@@ led@@ geable on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been bitten .
the fastest was at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone on the way .
since the construction site moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to a decrease in sales , everyone you ask is looking through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the refur@@ bish@@ ment has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bars are most heavily traffi@@ cked along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , Ste@@ ak@@ house owner , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street refur@@ bish@@ ment was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back two years ago &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to leave half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have changed otherwise .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , with the indication that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other rural districts , where something more generous is handled .
with all complaints G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars can now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic flow .
if you can &apos;t drive it , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family cliff returns to the end of the re@@ development work .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , that is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terror , laws are constantly scre@@ wed on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a tolerance of tolerance to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ charge anyone .
other , more detailed points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , he was in favor of results and reached a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions for the security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security agency should take care of sending encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms legislation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless thinks this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also presents de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have , in part , in themselves : he plans quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are deliberately brought into the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of Dul@@ ventions for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of these are politically and legally delicate .
some of them also seem to be un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to differentiate between refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , faced with the high number of refugees , many people were worried about safety .
and things that were pro@@ found@@ ly employed by people could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in election times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security has greatly moved into focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , between the two parties it went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ ten@@ tious dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also call for a ban on bur@@ ka and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here to reconci@@ le notes .
he thinks nothing of an aband@@ on@@ ment of a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not expe@@ dient .
and with a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it is only necessary to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things that could cause controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD is trying to improve on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
still Volkswagen has got off lightly .
despite diesel engines , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it doesn &apos;t work in all markets .
there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term in the recall campaign .
Volkswagen will be keeping track of deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer has a further advantage over the course of the year .
but in July , the core VW brand was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe , thereby reducing overall sales , as stated in the Da@@ x @-@ quoted company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries dropped by almost a sixth .
head of the brand , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weaker figures out of July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic environment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets has given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British ve@@ to to exit the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus can be found .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected household brand of Lower Saxony has got off lightly by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
from January to July , Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales platform .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software crash test .
in Germany alone , VW will call for some 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
according to the conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer delivered a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate but did not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in company circles .
reason to be legal fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen granted its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA Complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after conversion and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen regards the possibility that customers for example come in a workshop for example six months after the change@@ over - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall@@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scandal , as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in future criminal charges - second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; head of bank Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Banking talks about an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; normal spar@@ es would not have to worry about paying for their austerity measures . &quot;
if banks have money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent interest rate .
this fee will charge the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from retail and corporate customers for deposits more than 100,000 euros to sight deposit accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for quite some time he had 40 million Euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and that he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are with me on the central bank account and cause a reduction of 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot pay for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , the cost now continues .
leaving the cash on the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank counters would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already seen four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bayern regional association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank of Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had head@@ lines with criminal charges for deposits amoun@@ ting to three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay large @-@ scale fees for deposits , and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more luxuri@@ ant of wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it hil@@ t for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative compared to the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the migration of investors to competition .

destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before you rush to the comment section , to cross it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ S@@ sam@@ en@@ mens middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the revival of vinyl records is not on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mi@@ tig@@ ate mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after age 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely source of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something whis@@ per@@ ing like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly stands in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by watching .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight middle aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 boards .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the sn@@ apshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to re @-@ buy their old records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that call happy childhood memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a stack of plates fl@@ ushes out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never used , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , while I smoo@@ ther through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ consuming , less musi@@ bid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience as I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts new syn@@ thesizer and sexually @-@ packed pop , instead of experimental jazz , re@@ conc@@ iles from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ on@@ ate when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it is more window @-@ shopping than a shopping mall .
she does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives off with a fallen si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I cou@@ gh@@ ing the jeans shirt , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects signi@@ fies more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my investigations yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , do not take into account the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through records , while they steer clear of the star@@ tling view of an un@@ cann@@ y 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who sits on the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects special offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbor a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups judged the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a dish in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who had the 72 Pro@@ visional Busin@@ esses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely track@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the Camp , which is operated in a profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees living in the Cha@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager had increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic pas@@ time , cycli@@ st Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must quietly analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ aware world championship in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time @-@ timer World Champion , who had lost to Olympic champi@@ ons Fab@@ ian C@@ anc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to focus on the next generation speed meas@@ urer : in different federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes of lightning are being tested , which are to be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example in areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on motorway constructions or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ shing , there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that there is a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days at un@@ interrupted measurement operation , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as exit b@@ ans by time , travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ oned , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear outside outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the flash from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities are also flas@@ hing thanks to the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
UK catches silver in the 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold re@@ covers
Britain &apos;s impressive performance during the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back , line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad drum prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , in this form , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , they lost under R@@ yan every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one thing .
this slu@@ g will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonder@@ full and let the attacks boun@@ ce G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run in running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was hiding in the corner .
with another four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely gr@@ asp@@ ed the ball .
a har@@ ming t@@ ack of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u stressed by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favour of the South Sea sul@@ try whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced himself and GB ki@@ cked in a cr@@ ushing cast into the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of difference .
K@@ yle Brown finished the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no more em@@ oton@@ ous gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic champion in a row without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who placed such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9th ly un@@ worn insert , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the art of the triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no accompli@@ sh@@ er than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the break to a minimum if under such circumstances it is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning to talk more than otherwise and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the cent@@ uri@@ on of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have been working with , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t prepared to make some great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic Champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago it was in the original on a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia killed the con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the T@@ eck@@ verband staff , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ette mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency deployment on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the renovation of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has never been a stand@@ still , and I have always added new features because water is de@@ pressed and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of appreciation and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association .
the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest effort , however , were the tu@@ b@@ ular quar@@ ry at the chur@@ ch@@ yard at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something , which is two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting on partner
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and wounded her in a deadly manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the run , and he will be punished publicly .
by now , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burn and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ tice .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the fault or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more about this at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special action command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Look for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens im@@ pending by the industry from green electricity generation are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy turn@@ around in the existing systems for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
but this too is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emissions trading system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Hof@@ mann , CEO of IG Metall in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw masses of steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are acc@@ using Chinese steel corporations price d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China are bri@@ gh@@ tened .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been more likely to stagn@@ ate again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the economic association Stahl shared on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the amount produced went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has fallen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the teaching chamber , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp had this experience in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly request his lungs get out of the pu@@ dding in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
singing often has a very special effect on older people , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ taught people de@@ generate into long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , you should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior &apos;s choir , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the chur@@ ch@@ war@@ den .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , your family , friends or neighbors may ask for help from the Internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than tom@@ cat to the cries of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which effect is the calling of cat babies to adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ cked also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen degree of cat @-@ trays at the mi@@ ch@@ ow of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who consider themselves in great need , as scientists have found out from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - however always the same .
&quot; evidently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten @-@ scre@@ ams with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency distingu@@ ishes .
altogether nine adult males and eight female kit@@ tens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ p of little ones , taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed kit@@ tens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who do not have their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel more quickly to the driver when this calls off the very excited kit@@ tens .
this faculty may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey an important football game takes place again in Turkey .
before the du@@ el between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the arrest of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government did not interfere with the everyday life of normal citizens .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
football doesn &apos;t stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
according to this , the addi@@ ct living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ turn@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdoğan ended on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne &apos;s sporting value proved its worth in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season was a conci@@ li@@ atory finale for the record champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the South of Li@@ g it reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ve done this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 season hits as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que King , laid the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , at the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas only sold out Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt failed to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do this , however , the storm would have to be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish about a third of its annual sal@@ aries valued at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing lock , shortly before the games , was filled with mer@@ cil@@ essly on her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : she was still standing in the hall with a smiling face and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that it was not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a tower of ju@@ bil@@ ation .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champi@@ ons even runs faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic Champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit down for six months after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested positively on the Pro@@ hibited stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the un@@ miss@@ able intake and was closed for six months .
the four wi@@ dest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold favor@@ ites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , mut@@ ated mer@@ cen@@ sion .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympic Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also received the recognised bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the international sports court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record player and gold favor@@ ites were tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a prohibited dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans wounded - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the State Department , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she had suffered from wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sch@@ nö@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hu@@ a H@@ in located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , were initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
on the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded that killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ thi , Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express potential motives , but it is likely that it is the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and the places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the expected bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and environ@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , the necessary trips to these provinces will be dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ affir@@ ms itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several provincial offices , the conserv@@ atives in the federal government also made the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the Freedom of Freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why we are observing the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said that his authority decided to work closely with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with young people , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a pra@@ y@@ er@@ ful advertisement for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ arten said he didn &apos;t have any findings .
for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction and become extrem@@ ist by certain people who are extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not evident .
in view of the significant increase in criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups form attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee shel@@ ters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be identified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried Ma@@ ate expressed concern that many violations went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right @-@ hand scene .
that is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which have , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympic champi@@ ons or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ sized s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia swa@@ m so slowly that at times he could no longer be seen in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was granted special status from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b der W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on a &quot; well @-@ being &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made fun of him .
his time , he only sm@@ ote a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
unforgettable was the appearance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea s@@ wimm@@ ers , when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the lo@@ oming election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses U.S. presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
he described U.S. President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more opposition was formed .
post In@@ cre@@ ases Trading with Electric Transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously large .
the post plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group plans to start trade with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the post office wants to offer their electric vans out of the next year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post Board member Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , such as arti@@ sans .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to embar@@ k on mass production of vehicles soon .
in the post@@ age factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ d announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , make a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations came suddenly , but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the promised successes .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resignation of the corporate management , the global number five of the sector faces a new start .
G@@ RP Executive Officer plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Management Board already takes over the previous Executive Board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as early as September 1 , and shared the company with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive officer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokesman did not want to mention details on Friday .
it is still unclear who will be conducting the market research company in future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that in the shareholders the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago had been great .
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ RP summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , revenue shr@@ ank to 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 percent .
in view of its difficult economic situation , profit in the second quarter was imp@@ acted by the lower value of the company .
the impair@@ ment of EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience business unit gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cro@@ iss@@ ants in dit@@ ches : eight injured
in the event of an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered serious injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade a truck that was partly on the opposite lane .
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the bus &apos;s location , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2 .
the in@@ last travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to € 3.@@ 44 as of October 1 , 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the complex in Az@@ endorf the waste water fee will increase again later if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
after a high rate of calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ are@@ k will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that for these sewage plants under@@ cover .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems at a cost @-@ efficient manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises of Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg have to go deeper into the budget .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the body , a new calculation of fees for the waste water facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period should also be compensated .
according to the grave fees , Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
in addition , due to its age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expendi@@ tures , in all three systems , the lower calculation period was not least due to its age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the th@@ ig@@ h , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water plant in Az@@ endorf due to a damage .
after nearly 20 years of operation the first clari@@ fication pond had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge is disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to be able to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses include the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the small sewage plant in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully beat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
according to stone houses , the situation for these plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Wa@@ ste water @-@ purpose association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al cannot be expanded , because it is concerned with deficit facilities .
Bulgaria marks inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its Filter@@ tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ ended , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps reach the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them bad eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat shared that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused Ani@@ me Com@@ par@@ ison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ently and emp@@ tly said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with counter@@ ing a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filtering effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the descending extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration warfare , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counter@@ parts in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ atie Z@@ hu , 25 @-@ year @-@ old , in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rac@@ ist @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his co @-@ workers , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel officer who focuses on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she was closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership counter@@ f@@ eit IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , a Committee of In@@ quiry issued in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Alliance members , intelligence committees and the defence budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information typically served by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com agencies reported a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ ambique could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , the Central Command sp@@ ikes changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information , while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force &apos;s conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest rank Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the mor@@ als of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication that the White House interven@@ ed at Cent@@ Com analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; determined political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Con@@ gres@@ sional investigations were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who was taken up after complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress &apos;s reports while investigating the In@@ spec@@ tor General &apos;s investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question as to how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest app@@ rais@@ als of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature due to its exc@@ essively positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US won fourth match in the field hockey of the women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of the women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever being done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed one will take a little longer to the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans caused a surprising fuss about their success story , four years after landing at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey player in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn matters into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we can pull the ru@@ dder back completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gates in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the vicinity .
India was in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to get the American woman a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable , a ra@@ ving relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic round of tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not immediately illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may reign for a long time .
but if I would like to make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ sely perceived that many people who had asked me didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ si@@ ders of out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ to @-@ end impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ in and Di@@ ving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ edges and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to performance , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go ahead in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also a further high goal in television transmission : the world or the Olympic race .
the goal @-@ oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the vector of the tra@@ mp jum@@ per is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the En@@ dr@@ unden as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thropo@@ ids and the obj@@ ecting of male athletes - as the male US tur@@ ner suggests recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to breathe .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters who demand political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
over the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses gave that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous African country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist haz@@ ards beyond the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy grew at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restra@@ ined , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a much critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies have been the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were forced more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of the pre @-@ pot@@ ency under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , which does it at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are located .
several young Ethiop@@ ians preten@@ ded they had gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that also changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Bat@@ ch@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ingly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population , who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in an un@@ published illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special commission@@ ers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uprising was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , which , according to analysts , were apparently fu@@ elled by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest was passing relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an American city , by Tig@@ ray led businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests take the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights on the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently shared that it has closed this base .
while West@@ ern@@ ers clearly want to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin gr@@ ate hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS to be &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking that his multiple asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presi@@ dency candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible with the American public .
it also ent@@ ails its fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take refuge in the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant at all .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump came back in relation to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radiator host Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate didn &apos;t want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism pl@@ ashes on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling poll@@ s on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s email , but later he explained , &quot; Of course I meant sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction is . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to make his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more et@@ ched tone , as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general is trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ y has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it h@@ ind legs , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by allowing it to be aggressive under control in the Middle East .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks against the media and accused them of carrying around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats compla@@ ined about Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
So@@ ap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local bet@@ ro@@ thed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I can still not believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also a new invention .
a re@@ animated pub cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old coffee bar , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
verb used the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old club .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice bowls .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira recently was such a client on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point she would take the way .
after the club had closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to a quarter past seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he turns his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;re still going to deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice site wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was slightly more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the US while bricks were told in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter smoked min@@ ce , this found the couple suitable for a discussion on the food in the era of great depression .
&quot; rich food products were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet in an American household , especially in rural areas .
teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways in which the country moved to be no longer the Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne .
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central issue , &quot; Co@@ e explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ producing food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; was noted , as chefs were able to hide the appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat which was the centre of American cuisine for years became a rarely served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction takes preced@@ ence over flavor or even healthy kitchen sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeper recipes .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits nicely .
by public@@ ising recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; hous@@ em@@ akers &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ as like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ pie @-@ eating attitude .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he gar@@ ner@@ ed like the millions @-@ heavy man of the world he became .
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example on his stomach .
as described in the book , the preten@@ ding of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors made by Ms Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was disc@@ arded once the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods .
in writing the book , the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bricks were rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident .
after the plates were cleared off at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert made at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roosev@@ elt did eat at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone was reluct@@ ant to take a spo@@ on@@ ful in the t@@ amed , brown g@@ litter .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad .
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has even died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of civilians , which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life on the game in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil prot@@ ector who shows him about an 11 hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a marty@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the latest bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs above the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sh@@ arks get offspring only with 150 years .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates on a massive 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolution bi@@ ologist believed that Greenland would be stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees c@@ enti@@ grade , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their slow @-@ motion perceived them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ ro@@ ls at the bottom of the ice sea and seek car@@ c@@ asses that are tor@@ turing from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which fishermen collected between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitz@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks were notably carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960 &apos;s when nuclear weapons rec@@ uper@@ ate larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the 220 centimet@@ ers length of the third smallest animal , the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers have been able to classi@@ fy an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old har@@ poon point was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on a flame @-@ flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building site in a double pack
the Municipal Council focuses on topics related to building in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the committee adopted the communication by mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently designated living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ zel@@ li@@ zation and access issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for survey were made , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau appeal to young families and elderly people alike .
as it was said , building owners can now announce themselves in the Town Hall from now on , over the awar@@ ding of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to be able to meet requests for the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which is already designated there , is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
therefore , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract more jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Global Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London for financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been approved in the UK so far .
they are using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk group .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg ad@@ mitt@@ edly conce@@ als a large fund industry , but does not cut off the infrastructure as well as Dublin &apos;s infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
the city also boasts easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultants Mer@@ cer , the city stands on seventh place , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in London , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
gi@@ lead ob@@ tains legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co . Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a payment of damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ from@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is enti@@ t@@ lement to the cost incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and took possession of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
troops supported by the United States have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters allied to the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband &apos;s presidential candidate an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former foreign minister Bill Clinton earned an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations over the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim K@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump@@ et special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release anything before tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ ump@@ backs Cri@@ tics , among others also the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton receives a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump invited to a meeting to discuss their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit by the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return by the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , mean an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only received USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , which tax@@ ed the divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ters , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ters .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already had the idea years ago , has intensified its funding along with the US natural protection , by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the world , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool@@ kit &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the elephant in doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ de mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the f@@ use only .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ es into the air .
a touch is usually already out to chase the elephant .
the last option is a laun@@ cher shooting a gol@@ fing fire@@ works in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
unanim@@ ous decision : no Ki@@ osk new building at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects with Kus@@ sh@@ land take on - but the retail store in the core city is regarded as clearly exp@@ and@@ able .
however , the City Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a commercial building on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bel@@ kon@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pres@@ election because Arab guests were &quot; challenged &quot; according to an employee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shot him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the Internet , in which people called it a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , stands near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick @-@ selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police force tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students clas@@ hed with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , leading the police to rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ffiti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent over the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , divided the ambassador with them .
Russian companies are taking existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trading is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade expansion was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes to Russia this year from a record number of Iranian tourists .
last year , the Russian representative had around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily pas@@ sports , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a gun @-@ weapon , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the release of cash by the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money was captured .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is not visible .
after the attack , the perpetrators must travel towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , shall urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun game and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youths of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ loving group was quartered in the quiet , leisure time theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ alen with the visit of the string z@@ oos .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group of the deep sea met in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ egi@@ vers were treated to culinary delights with their own body courses such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were made , beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people were satisfied .

four stages were tac@@ kled jointly .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ish pilgrimage of all mini@@ stries in two years , the senior minister round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally , the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , was offered a special pilgrimage destination for the opening of the gates of mercy to Freiburg Cathedral .
16 And Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the sanctuary opened their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady is standing and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s path started from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts .
but also on the way the Min@@ is started to sing again on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from specially arranged pilgri@@ m song .
for the overnight stays the parish church of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stage targets , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and also strengthening dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
next day , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to be desc@@ ended at first around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and walked through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed .
the Min@@ is Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the B@@ reis@@ gau@@ met@@ rop@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Sh@@ ots Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home when Brit@@ on wins Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ged last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ ds appeared .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scot@@ sman that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner won an Olympic record in qualifying rounds , but in the standard round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that went into a higher gear in order to slow it down and enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic board in the final round and beat the world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der said that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle current .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Braun &apos;s W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers race .
they reached the target in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had fought with agents before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Des@@ ire , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional display of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the future of the melting of Port@@ land by lifting the energy yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations for workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus lifts all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company shared .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , preventing further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the system of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angl@@ es@@ ea &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power plant last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force as of November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ bility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not affect &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still a declaration of why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the sector before possible closure of the Port@@ land melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and a total of around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity each year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on its Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or easy keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , sc@@ rap@@ ed reality video showing the entire kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the all @-@ popular show bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of keeping up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ical act of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we should have forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow on this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes what the Vo@@ gue Cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine will leak before the official announcement .
women , who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all about Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ tes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ations Centers assign 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary states are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair discrimination and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land community centres of Que@@ es@@ land , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Emergency Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land municipal care centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debt , families who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we urge the General Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly remove these short@@ cuts , so that people can receive the assistance they need in legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after collabor@@ ators allegedly drew a gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign was indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ activity after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had a gun for a staff in February while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for months to have waited for the matter internally , before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that wouldn &apos;t happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the campaign , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew a pist@@ ol , put his right index finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mmed the course in Vinc@@ ent Kne@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined at the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charge comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered an u@@ pro@@ ar when he said a crowd in North Carolina states that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge .
Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign clearly stated that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ inary &apos;s appeal demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and remaining mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ backs was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from its consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has previously led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) substantial losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could not go@@ vern in the north , it is not possible after the survey data in Berlin .
in both states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party is just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent again .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey , only 23 per cent of the survey ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) would have been selected at the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they thus still lie behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would extend today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those at that time : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit very slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , that is about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
in August 1996 , no one could suspect that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; cell phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates suppliers that all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s everyday life for a lot of people today .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs in Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s victory began , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today , every German now watches 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new teachers alone , creating 40,000 new jobs and bringing an end to youth unemployment in the airport .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equ@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ings on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding regarding its advertisements in order to make it harder to detect the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth battle between the time @-@ breaking open source community and the um@@ pers has been underway since the invention of scor@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display block@@ ers have become for the industry .
according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active on Facebook about their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and Inst@@ agra@@ m , the company shared a spokesperson .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment for such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be updating its &quot; ad preferences pool &quot; to give people more control over advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Facebook spokesman in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide to over@@ ride Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark , &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police told in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them to report this as well as any witness to the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a preliminary investigation has been opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , shared G@@ illes court @-@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - has been decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after she left a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took up judgment .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived
the Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected er@@ d@@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed to more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protect against faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotating of the Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable once , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped , there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy stepping back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately seek a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth what it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also has to have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick told me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was awarded the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to score five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ s@@ men resume talks , strike strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , as all the parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood @-@ Field Service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will last a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , starting next year to re @-@ address the problems .
the unions said their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has this year shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has dischar@@ ged thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Consulting .
energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes ever taking place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster to different rates as well as in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other con@@ stell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large quantities of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since these winds travel through the magnet @-@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic Laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ple@@ j@@ ade star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars will slow down their rotation rates and hang their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports extensively about their latest analysis of the ple@@ j@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 year old pro will take the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game player of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) announced .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mile@@ stones .
the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only show two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
but the 41 year old is not likely to be included in the Ruh@@ mes@@ halle of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal up to the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received funding for years using an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legend lives in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vil@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a learned athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ vil@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded from the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full co @-@ operation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova was also le@@ aking during the night of Rio , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is alleged that in the forbidden substance the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to his criticism of the athlete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation must not take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them are competing , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , even the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming , the former clubs in China also ensured violent fights between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ els@@ li@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the Podium for 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was tested positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ine in the Chinese Championships , but had to wait only for a three @-@ month lock .
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware currently target companies - and are successful .
according to a survey conducted by the malware self @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data collected .
according to the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes &apos; observations , the perpetrators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially resulting ran@@ som will be considerably higher than private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 most of the animation programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and delete the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users find the personal photo database on the game , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage drops when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break down their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rator &apos;s call in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ code example files for free .
and if private individuals rede@@ em payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly bar@@ gain and pay five @-@ digit sums to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Anti @-@ Virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software tool@@ box to the actual black@@ mail .
the up @-@ to @-@ date malware kits have been created by installing malware yourself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for further hack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log into one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of respon@@ dents in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exc@@ esses , the offen@@ ders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the damage potential is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in future , the perpetrators will also be able to take entirely new targets on the internet of things .
on the de@@ co conference of Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block a complete production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ speed and 10@@ 26 l at revers@@ ed back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the security systems is the city emergency brake assist ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; while maneu@@ vering .
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to road sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity , however , is only available for top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ socket are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .

airline cannot be held liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay ?
after their journey , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ tless in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish bath .
she spent almost all the holidays in the room .
their disease caused the tourists to return to a defective sewage plant , which was supposed to pol@@ lu@@ te the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was poor - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the wastewater treatment plant was indeed defective .
however , the Organ@@ izer was only informed shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
no contamination was found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among themselves - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence done by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further attacks .
the state must be disposed of and , at the same time , react to terrorist haz@@ ards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and sch@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , however , this increases the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realisation of the proposals until the Bundestag election 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the ar@@ mis@@ tice has been am@@ ended to make it difficult for the purchase of weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is supposed to be preserved according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions , such as the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a view on psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister holds a better social care .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the exec@@ ution@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a ban on bur@@ ka and the abolition of dual nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general ban on enforcement of the whole is un@@ constitutional .
you cannot ban everything you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green Chief Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of plot@@ ting with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets of action and ability to act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ ole regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the balance of law should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the environmental road every evening when they drive via the Autobahn @-@ Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ eler Road exit .
drivers can then slide right from the hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic is divided in the early stages , which improves the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Federal Highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back @-@ jam goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity in order to absorb heavy traffic in two lanes .
the state company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the inter@@ connected con@@ ges@@ tion will last .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining use@@ age up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislative branch , the state enterprise deliberately selected the traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities it is expected to be expected .
the traffic is passed to the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project now .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the prize @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater of Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 pupils visited the Small House between 11 and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association has been offering the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to the goal , schools with welcome classes have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the youth of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic photos and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theater in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the Junge Theater will cooperate in the coming season within the framework of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professional courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language convey@@ ance are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased number of refugees the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the con@@ stellation Gu@@ ck@@ ern a stroke by the bill in the southwest of Germany in the night of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is no longer necessary to think of sleep in the morning before the wake @-@ up ring .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes , emphas@@ ised Hans @-@ Günter B@@ ust , member of the board of the German Society for slaughter and sleeping medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleep disorder .
it is precisely the sleep that many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are mutually dependent .
for example , anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der over everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disturbances become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out its causes .
the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or drugs - classical sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , has hardly been established in Germany .
therefore , when sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises on the advice .
it can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , for the investigation of sleep fl@@ ab@@ or , medical professionals advise for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , in cases of sleep@@ iness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , &quot; Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose mask , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera stands at the ceiling to the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can victims get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few jack@@ bolts on which you can set for a better sleep .
it counts : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the watch - then you start counting immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he picked up gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has been protecting himself from his ex @-@ team@@ mates in his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0.000 € nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , but the dop@@ ing control is very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to report nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be maintained with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 died on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ bags and luggage ste@@ els .
at 9 : 30 p.m. , civilian officials at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a gang known to polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several acts of delic@@ acy since the middle of July of this year .
the Speci@@ alists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had traveled to Germany to commit crimes specifically for crimes committed in Germany .
in doing so , they had carried out a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lime trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stone : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this at first sight , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad .
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; jumped onto the facade of a grey house .
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be disman@@ tled soon , is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is prefer@@ enti@@ ally illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior designer Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action of the police against the project , the area known as the &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , renovated building workers have the premises .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers retired from the che@@ ers of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who plays three children here , are gener@@ v@@ t above all by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to force a majority of police protection against the v@@ and@@ alized left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police open between home occup@@ ants and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in , in the East of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class quarter , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was placed under great police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world in recent years . residents of East Germany and former home occup@@ iers now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the rentals that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by disc@@ arded windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are made up of damages which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is vit@@ ally important : the 94 people are their neighbours , who were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained .
this is why it was so important that residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , in the end , con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here people live , who are not so well cared for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
who draws you should be aware of this - just like somebody who moves into a pub district , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the Arbeits@@ kreis points out that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the fer@@ vent wool mel@@ low , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ ck@@ ingly than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the job out .
we were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a hil@@ arious wo@@ ollen yar@@ n .
but administrative work is not its central position , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people , and also behind the scenes as well as networking .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers in the washing line soon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired lodging areas .
the municipalities themselves must bear the costs of construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work so far , but one is dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , commun@@ iti@@ sed apartments must be re@@ plen@@ ished , as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments is it not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a firm place of residence , there are plac@@ ements , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and lending service for refugees and migrants who need to be strengthened or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not mean only work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here too there are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not want to work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problem cases , says the customer honestly , &quot; people in whom nothing is concerned . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What some may call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ vo@@ king them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
in doing so , they have always in the background that a new stopp@@ age of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already working to integrate the people in a reasonable way .
currently , this is about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
