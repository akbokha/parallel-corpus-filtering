<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home to the forage in a fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family over the system of the ALRV, he didn't even swell for photo purposes on a horse.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Pyramid of Sports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silver laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been supporting young people.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and trumps economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - that's what Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential Compositions are, however, in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive regulators massively, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "on the other hand, Clinton says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that respect, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump, there could be some party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement hopes to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziffer trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, for example, for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump does not want to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rise, and then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be sloppy, and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report about five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something terrible had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was aroused.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this ehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey seriously - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti described it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes are long here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "Ankara is angry towards the West, as it looks at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the ongoing resentment on the auger pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship with the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara on the fact that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime changes.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and feel bad and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents were told at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided addressing a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="3">Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="4">He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.</seg>

<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of Modernism and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, only a few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>

<seg id="23">It was nerve wrecking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest confidence committee for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement by the Kremlin it is that Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the staff and staff of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "about his appointment he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest intimate Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president - would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin site, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - entrust a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people to whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term of National Putins violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy, Keith Brown, today paid a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck in their place and the last section of the deck is given a kick-off for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and low-rise buildings.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens say," "" "Investors should be taken much more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD will propose a" "" "living room for action" "" "at the next meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But the fight is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it concerns the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said SPD leader Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all flats as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built in the stocks.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the big issue in the town hall is, Bratmann said, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new housing development programme that will cost millions and will still have to be financed should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still impose tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding that, Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme does not yet fully exist: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how to compensate for the loss of other around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now buy-out bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West Town, Fristen are running out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be found there back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the residential construction companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased, one will be removed from the goal of the so-called "mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go on board." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, instead prefer to spend their free time on screens, has been depleted by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many Popular phenomena, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than inks and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person restores each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an Apple Watch App, followed by 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the market launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for performance enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "30 minutes time" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" on deaf ears, because many public messages about health are boring and coming from people that look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sport reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also mürk playing fans, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt become more active, more fit and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all of this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">All along the line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast invaded the competition title on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles turnt on the balance beam during the solo multi-campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lou Rescue Team said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign inale of women at the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">A part of her floor exercises, which contain her typical Tumbling Pass, is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiad in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gym where boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has no longer lost a competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina ran through two turns, the picture was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beams and ground throws - in which it holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She picked up again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and placed another 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her enderment - pure formality - and tears poured on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year old man capitaine, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she threw the audience's kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine doing at the Women's Olympics in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been there at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Katholikin, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one of the female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America jubilant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnastic classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastic primarily in private gymnastic clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnastic and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both her athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the communities aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy to access turn training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holmes of the Olympic team gold and thank you, ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anti-inflammatory drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that make plaque build.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that stops the flow of blood up to the heart, causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots release, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name of Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Insurance Centre, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright chees his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe for a guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and Würgereflex by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk cut off his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before removing any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking the rinsing button on a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily nothing left what he leaned, more than a bad taste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to flush-buttoning of toilets, the task of the immune system was definitely under a test.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometer speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which refused to leak after their luminometric rating exceeded 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things that I instructed him to lick up like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their apartment after a delogiation with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treportcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had plastered holes, wooden boards were piled up, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think that people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this estate is thought to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screams, strikers and floods included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have had to co-operate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a delogization is always the last step taking into consideration Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The IOC plans to set up a disciplinary committee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kenya's athletes face the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary reported that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson roti.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Team Principal of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Association of IAAF has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson said.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the study and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate," it was said in an IAAF statement.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and, as Ferguson roti, issued and signed the trial," stated Kenya's Chief de Mission, Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2015 Ferguson rotich became more than 800 meters in Beijing World Cup four-fourth.</seg>
<seg id="13">Four days before, the Kenyan team leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.</seg>
<seg id="14">He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country about upcoming doping tests.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to media reports, he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport.</seg>
<seg id="16">Kenya is already under special observation at the IOC after numerous doping associations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks presented by the IOC in front of the Rio games, it was not unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, WADA have taken Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with the rules of WADA.</seg>
<seg id="21">Kenya is considered a big runner-nation.</seg>
<seg id="22">The athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations were repeatedly made that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports betting.</seg>
<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired them in the Russian athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be proven that this kind of sport has been systematically deactivated in this sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30am in the morning and only end at 20 o'clock, there is praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they've done everything pretty much," "" "Elvira Tetzlaff says of the jet fuel station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "there will also be the opposite of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up homes." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is back again, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The transit through the village seems to be going back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable discomfort," "" "said Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaks were looking and more familiar with their navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What caused some trucks to be francised in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the community also called for amplification of the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a decrease in sales, everyone you ask is looking through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for whom the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "at most slight decline" "" "also at Autohaus Maier, but also admits that" "" "the running documents are missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The bars are most heavily trafficked along the road.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">He has to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, the policy would have changed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would benefit otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other rural districts, where something more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars can now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic flow.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive it, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family cliff returns to the end of the redevelopment work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that is brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to cross it under the pseudonym non-AlleSsamenmens middle age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the revival of vinyl records is not on a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to mitigate midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after age 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely source of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the midst of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and grazing wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something whispering like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly stands in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by watching.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to re-buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that call happy childhood memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff from a stack of plates flushes out." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never used, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, while I smoother through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle ages), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-consuming, less musibid.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience as I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts new synthesizer and sexually-packed pop, instead of experimental jazz, reconciles from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the psychic traumas are hard to detonate when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more window-shopping than a shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives off with a fallen sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I coughing the jeans shirt, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects signifies more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my investigations yielded that the results of YouGov vote, they, at least in record stores in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectibles that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebees on Berwick Street and the leaves through records, while they steer clear of the startling view of an uncanny 30-year-old false presenter who sits on the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which harbor a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups judged the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers need to focus on the next generation speed measurer: in different federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashes of lightning are being tested, which are to be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic-acting Enforcement Trailer from the Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example in areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement through the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway constructions or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed polishing, there is often no necessary infrastructure in order to ensure that there is a stationary flash for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days at uninterrupted measurement operation, and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology allows all vehicles to be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as exit bans by time, travel stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the highly-driven state one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>

<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance during the 7-year Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side steppe, back, line and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad drum prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, in this form, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck: Fijis's head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost under Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slug will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfull and let the attacks bounce GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run in running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was hiding in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely grasped the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A harming tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou stressed by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favour of the South Sea sultry whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced himself and GB kicked in a crushing cast into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown finished the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in a row without a control woman in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, who placed such a standard.</seg>

<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the art of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental advances that make the difference and there was no accomplisher than the trainer who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>

<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the break to a minimum if under such circumstances it is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years old in the Teckverband staff, of which 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes annually about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunette mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the association in 1988.</seg>

<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the elevated tanks (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has never been a standstill, and I have always added new features because water is depressed and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he really lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to the nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of appreciation and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he described the well construction and the restructuring of the association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the hardest effort, however, were the tubular quarry at the churchyard at Kirchlouder on January 3rd.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Look for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens impending by the industry from green electricity generation are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains with the release of the Renewable Energy turnaround in the existing systems for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry," "" "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday issue)." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">According to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is required.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify when the world's largest producer of products threw masses of steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are accusing Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China are brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have been more likely to stagnate again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the economic association Stahl shared on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the amount produced went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the teaching chamber, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives," "" "Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Ursel Kipp had this experience in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly request his lungs get out of the pudding in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, self-taught people degenerate into long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior's choir, you can simply connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the churchwarden.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, your family, friends or neighbors may ask for help from the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic champions or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly oversized swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that at times he could no longer be seen in the TV images.</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian was granted special status from the International Swimming Federation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen run in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>

<seg id="16">Based on a "well-being" the English boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he only smote a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the Equatorial Guinea swimmers, when he had to compete in a race over 100 metres of Freestyle alone.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises of Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg have to go deeper into the budget.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>

<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, due to its age of refurbishment and repair expenditures, in all three systems, the lower calculation period was not least due to its age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complex in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for the thigh, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Snapchat" "" "Anime" "" "effect as an Asian caricature criticised" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its Filtertool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blended, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past where they were accused of promoting the app Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them bad eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused Anime Comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweet about the photos became widespread that the filter" "" "violently and emptly said" "" "was unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with countering a very contradictory Asian caricature and filtering effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the descending extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration warfare, from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older counterparts in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "when one of Snapchats Filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," "" "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed when it was the case," "" "said Katie Zhu, 25-year-old, in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racist-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his co-workers, but according to a speaker, the company recently hired a personnel officer who focuses on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she was closed to her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosambique could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command spikes changed the intelligence reports to downplay the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information, while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force's conclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years of 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," the highest rank Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "accused the morals of analysts and" "" "gave excessively little room for dissenting opinion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication that the White House intervened at CentCom analyst in terms of a "determined political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congressional investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who was taken up after complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress's reports while investigating the Inspector General's investigations.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question as to how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest appraisals of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds more than ten years ago when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature due to its excessively positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a setback from the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and knocked the ball into the gate to get the American woman a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel continuous and inevitable, a raving relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed from the wristwatch to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic games and a women's swarm with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic round of trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not immediately illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports not generally recognized: air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparsely perceived that many people who had asked me didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsiders of outsiders, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-to-end impact - but also the Grazie of Turnin and Diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, hedges and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to performance, difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go ahead in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also a further high goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the tramp jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the Endrunden as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objecting of male athletes - as the male US turner suggests recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to breathe.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters who demand political changes in Ethiopia clashed with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous African country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist hazards beyond the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy grew at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restrained, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a much criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies have been the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of the pre-potency under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which does it at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are located.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians pretended they had gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Batchu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairingly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population, who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unpublished illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special commissioners to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such an uprising was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently fuelled by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and that time of unrest was passing relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an American city, by Tigray led businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests take the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights on the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently shared that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While Westerners clearly want to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS to be "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday by attacking that his multiple assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidency candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also entails its fellow campaigners who endeavour to take refuge in the peculiar position, statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump came back in relation to the statement on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiator host Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn't want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism plashes on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling polls on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's email, but later he explained, "Of course I meant sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive and then, if necessary," clarify "according to what the reaction is." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to make his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more etched tone, as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general is trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumpy has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumpet's most prominent advocates, gave a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumpet's statements whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hind legs, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread out by allowing it to be aggressive under control in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks against the media and accused them of carrying around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats complained about Mr. Trumpet's apology as a further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once upon the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigoted cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came from his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which was replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local betrothed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also a new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A reanimated pub cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing member of the old coffee bar, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old club.</seg>

<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishings like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice bowls.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Rebecca Oliveira recently was such a client on a Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint she would take the way.</seg>

<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came to a quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal is still getting his usual order, but sometimes he turns his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on this day was slightly more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a small, local snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter smoked mince, this found the couple suitable for a discussion on the food in the era of great depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food products were very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-Eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" draws the ways in which the country moved to be no longer the Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central issue," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious dishes such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of reproducing food leftovers" was noted, as chefs were able to hide the appetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat which was the centre of American cuisine for years became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange blends have been tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction takes precedence over flavor or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>

<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular addition at lunch time," "" "Coe says." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeper recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country's eating habits nicely.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publicising recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housemakers" and the challenge to transform pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic treats." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-pie-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he openly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he garnered like the millions-heavy man of the world he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked Continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to postpone an example on his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the pretending of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors made by Ms Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was discarded once the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">In writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law - for example, how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "bricks were recalled:" "" "they really made people ill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the incident.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks get offspring only with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates on a massive 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolution biologist believed that Greenland would be stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees centigrade, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion perceived them when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrols at the bottom of the ice sea and seek carcasses that are torturing from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks which fishermen collected between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest size was 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lentil nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were notably carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960's when nuclear weapons recuperate larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal, the lentil nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have been able to classify an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the increase obviously allow for at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusaleme live above all in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoon point was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on a flame-flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gets heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raged last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hinds appeared.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinds, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner won an Olympic record in qualifying rounds, but in the standard round the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation that went into a higher gear in order to slow it down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic board in the final round and beat the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinder said that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle current.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for the British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a spoils of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Braun's Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They reached the target in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had fought with agents before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Desire, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie archives soon of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbing, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would extend today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 communicator" "" "came to shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euro lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those at that time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit very slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that is about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">In August 1996, no one could suspect that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we took a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already have 10,000 new teachers alone, creating 40,000 new jobs and bringing an end to youth unemployment in the airport.</seg>

<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamed on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>

<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on its desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook shared that its desktop page would change coding regarding its advertisements in order to make it harder to detect the recognition of which part of the advertising page is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth battle between the time-breaking open source community and the umpers has been underway since the invention of scorers," and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media enterprise has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="5">A woman laid down in the dark, "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police told in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overdriven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - has been decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after she left a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street, took up judgment.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have rejected erdlike conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably pointed to more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect against faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotating of the Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months," "" "said scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously suspected by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable once, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in star cluster to different rates as well as in which context the rotational periods are associated with planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other constellations, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars repel large quantities of constellations.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnet-fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>

<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just about 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-Trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires full co-operation in the investigation," "" "said Xinhua from a communication:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The news about the positive rehearsal at Danekova was also leaking during the night of Rio, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "stated the athletic." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is alleged that in the forbidden substance the blood doping agent EPO should act.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should also have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately reported to his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "", "the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them are competing, but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, Danekowa's case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic doping, even the Läufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, the former clubs in China also ensured violent fights between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion, Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "sun Yang pinkelslila" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the Podium for 200 m Freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun stood at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014 Sun was tested positively on the stimulant Trimetacine in the Chinese Championships, but had to wait only for a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a survey conducted by the malware self-defense specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the systems and data collected.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the Malwarebytes' observations, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially resulting ransom will be considerably higher than private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," says Malwarebytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the animation programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database on the game, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage drops when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported loss of revenue by ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break down their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrator's call in the face of standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user areas and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decode example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals redeem payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly bargain and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the Anti-Virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolbox to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The up-to-date malware kits have been created by installing malware yourself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of respondents in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful excesses, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the damage potential is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will also be able to take entirely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the deco conference of Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block a complete production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "there is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-speed and 1026 l at reversed backrests, but there is the" "" "Magic Seats" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a child seat and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work should be somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is encouraging.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the security systems is the city emergency brake assist (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" while maneuvering.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to road sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity, however, is only available for top features: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI-socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>

<seg id="6">Drivers can then slide right from the hammer street to the right.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is no longer necessary to think of sleep in the morning before the wake-up ring.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes, emphasised Hans-Günter Bust, member of the board of the German Society for slaughter and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an entry and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleep that many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially in case of depression," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are mutually dependent.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, anyone who has a herniated disc can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder over everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the disturbance, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or drugs - classical sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, has hardly been established in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises on the advice.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for the investigation of sleep flabor, medical professionals advise for example in snoring with respiratory disorders, in cases of sleepiness, sleepwalkers or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, "Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose mask, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands at the ceiling to the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can victims get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few jackbolts on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts: regular bedtime and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid drinking alcohol and at night do not look at the watch - then you start counting immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 died on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handbags and luggage steels.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 p.m., civilian officials at Dusseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to policemen from past theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several acts of delicacy since the middle of July of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Crime Commissariat 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves, who had traveled to Germany to commit crimes specifically for crimes committed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so, they had carried out a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some lime trees, in between still a rest of cobblestone: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this at first sight, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes at playgrounds, a fresco kindergarten and a biolad.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" jumped onto the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be dismantled soon, is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferentially illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior designer Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a hard action of the police against the project, the area known as the "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrolled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, renovated building workers have the premises.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers retired from the cheers of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are genervt above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to force a majority of police protection against the vandalized left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police open between home occupants and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, in the East of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was placed under great police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from all over the world in recent years. residents of East Germany and former home occupiers now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rentals that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by discarded windows or freshly painted facades thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often as" "" "Left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours regard this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as bodily injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are made up of damages which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is vitally important: the 94 people are their neighbours, who were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important that residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the German sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "that is, in the end, condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here people live, who are not so well cared for," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can't approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws you should be aware of this - just like somebody who moves into a pub district, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the Arbeitskreis points out that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there now, the fervent wool mellow, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mockingly than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that administration wanted to write the job out.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a hilarious woollen yarn.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central position, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people, and also behind the scenes as well as networking.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the washing line soon</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the provision of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired lodging areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves must bear the costs of construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work so far, but one is dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, communitised apartments must be replenished, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments is it not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm place of residence, there are placements, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and lending service for refugees and migrants who need to be strengthened or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too there are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not want to work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people in whom nothing is concerned." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer clearly," "" "What some may call naïve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely revoking them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they have always in the background that a new stoppage of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's client also makes clear that the Urbachs are already working to integrate the people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, this is about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
