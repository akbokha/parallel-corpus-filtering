Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlements and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program has further deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the talk was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming elections in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a trem@@ bling voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officers found the body of A@@ my pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school complex , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency call at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting in the university , forcing students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and co @-@ workers who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
they both signed up in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not provide a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escap@@ ing from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane again when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still running .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
in the spring he received a doc@@ torate in education .
one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was the s@@ warm of women back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through Ab@@ ig@@ ail &apos;s daughter , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played some gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l watch , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to make our students return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the cry after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
ys R Us is planning to employ fewer workers for Christmas
To@@ ys R Us says it will not hire as many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to supply shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remarkable for personal reasons as well .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a length of arms away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unden@@ i@@ ably the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the sp@@ li@@ ts in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban also called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks at surveys , it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
of course it &apos;s too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now detect tears of per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollars flow in order to overthrow it .
here are some recent survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
drop@@ out popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa observed last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ torate GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abli@@ sh@@ ments , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same figure is valid in the nation &apos;s first country , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose their scholars , republi@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , four out of ten last week say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it is shown that a large number of GO@@ P voters see Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathering around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented space is likely to lead to dro@@ pl@@ ine leadership , whereas the anti @-@ pump support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters supporting Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change your mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigrants from Mexico , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al issue in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep vital His@@ pan@@ o Americans out of the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as immigration is left in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with experience in government .
and they &apos;re also angry at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fern@@ ally anger@@ ed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; here in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hob@@ oo@@ ky Way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the street , one square meter of a th@@ et@@ le house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows the particular locations a square metre cost the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square metre for a student residence in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a barrel .
a successful hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bavaria to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have set a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol hits ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth launch in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received the aid of Olympic med@@ alli@@ sts for Olympic med@@ als in the Champions League for the 28th time in the Champions League , which allowed himself to pass a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Kapitän Philipp Lah@@ em had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans in front of the game at the Kar@@ ai k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home matches in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they gra@@ c@@ efully went to work with their offensive efforts , but often too un@@ err@@ ingly .
the attacks were initiated too often by displacement at left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely passed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the upper right corner of the tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best chances in half one .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stor@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the Tor@@ wart Coff@@ in par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians cra@@ ved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus succeeded in putting needle stit@@ ches .
but on door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to defend a four @-@ cur@@ b chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias S@@ mer at Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different , it &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Götz@@ e was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , using El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made another one .
before the game , there was a tie at the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly spoiled Bavarian fans obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bavarian fan was hur@@ ried out of the stadium .
anyone who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : without ren@@ oun@@ cement , the risk falls quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more common gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained creator Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , results in a good dental health up to the old age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 @-@ 74 years of tooth@@ lessness is concerned , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter fragments from the late Anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer on the Rhine River
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department for archae@@ ology .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found their way .
from text documents it has already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
beside remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , probably belonging to the church .
young woman seized by freight train
after a young woman arrives at the railway station in the Gei@@ dan@@ i@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ ders station , the German police asks the population to help .

EU Commission suggests new court in dispute on TTIP
the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to improve the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström on the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people is to be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the USA , and from third countries .
the second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no possibility to claim their sentences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an International Investment Court .
there could be , for example , dispute between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a sort of parallel read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment to permit companies to pay damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act referred the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised for the fact that they are not supposed to be valid for the already negotiated Free Trade Agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German State Secretary for Economic Affairs , Matthias Eis@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy @-@ looking folk singer recorded the picturesque American state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they arose and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative mis@@ er .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan , the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always be wonderfully opul@@ ent at any time .
the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states in the United States should be ob@@ s@@ essed .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
his guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , 2005 is a celebrated masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exu@@ ber@@ ant of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not in any list of records of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) with extensive electronic sales . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
since the smaller club has long gone out , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ brow@@ band and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs , the clearly ri@@ cher St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sla@@ b fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only at an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens modest , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally ends up with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awaited at the Prime Minister &apos;s round of questions
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will release his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six questions briefly after noon , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs close by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain in silence during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the center of several news stories in newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliam@@ ent@@ arian party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; stack , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said that Labour would make amendments to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he &apos;s boss , over the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another set of policies , says that he has given &quot; crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subject to &quot; head@@ strong &quot; and stri@@ fe with hooks , and instead has undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela eagle , the shadow economic minister is represented in him , if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Represent@@ atives , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy Theater &quot; which is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted he had failed .
since it was broadcast on television in 1990 , the meeting with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and its position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and requires far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound is rising by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose steep@@ ly according to data indicating an increase in the income growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s goal .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and inv@@ alu@@ able estimate since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures reflect all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
stocks of Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining industry said that it had $ 2.5 billion in share selling as part of its debt reduction strategy .
Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company shares were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports commit@@ ting company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in its company , &quot; he says .
the costs could meet J@@ D Sports &apos;s expansion plans , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carl@@ ton .
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin Y@@ ester@@ day .
including E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
but since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as her m@@ um E@@ wa deserves half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

who cares ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even be@@ aver doesn &apos;t .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
he collected three million dollars for the promotional print in the supermarket , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , be@@ aver collects as well .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is astonished at the window pane .
it is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No@@ .1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t care about the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings the Lebanese to the potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both are in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ y owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat have put together a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in its shop , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese has meanwhile been registered by the Patent Office in Munich .
there it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority .
Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of international understanding is also good for its customers .
met@@ a La@@ un@@ ches Sustainability Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ a launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ ering and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will carry out its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game because South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take over five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and Met@@ ering could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business , and in the amount of fixed @-@ cost Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA shop@@ pers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase sales and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that met@@ a would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ a refused to publicly respond to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ ering contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ GA@@ S market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Retail , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler continues to invest more than $ 150 million to compare sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores through fast growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ ading programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and ear@@ ns in the opinion of the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise than criticism for his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; entered the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious fight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison soon had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison shou@@ ted , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally sigh@@ ted as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential U.S. Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was standing firmly defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles next Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite anno@@ yed about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a bat when he lost a hit in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also assisted the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent feature to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick has made the climb very quickly , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants recovered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled violence were stuck in a strip of land on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pat@@ rol police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some had returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation @-@ bloc at a con@@ ten@@ tious meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the un@@ awar@@ es Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would record another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions announced on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has stopped a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used during the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the approaching economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia became a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities got 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to get in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet declared whether he is candidate for the Pres@@ idential Office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton keeps a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support with the men has dropped mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is only back here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic elec@@ tors under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a great lead in the older voters .
in the past month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say that they would enthusi@@ astically support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would support them only because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic above all by her .
the views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
from Clinton &apos;s followers more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to nom@@ inate the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton points ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic vot@@ er call questions about the vot@@ abl@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some key features among voters of the sel@@ ections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den are honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs continues to be questioned , most of the Demo@@ crat voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public in total .
half of the Americans are now unhappy with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that her opinion still deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump at nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the recent C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support is eliminated in the new survey , and others are losing a dramatic shift in support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but in the same period , Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor of Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % on the third place .
the margin of error in sample 3@@ 76 individuals from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son goes up in the poll@@ s - he ends with 19 % support with the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ jack@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea any more : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
nearly two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , a student was filed against five persons .
members of the Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an entry ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police told .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide their imple@@ ments and generally set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood through that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sh@@ eff Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the individuals involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned it - officially or un@@ officially - that &apos;s how we will be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the hous@@ et@@ op will be shaken , loans for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months following the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end market participants could , however , find that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view based on historical trends , how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rises can make things volatile for a while .
once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets depreci@@ ated 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after interest rises of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - roughly 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis that published by Bob D@@ oll , CEO of Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield will begin to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the nominal GDP has only twice as much as 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rises in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants spent the whole year on an increase in interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC can appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade only has a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all reimbur@@ sement cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists quickly put in the shade after the onset of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipated an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
in bonds , returns seem to change direction once the first increase / fall in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle , the investment den@@ si@@ ties immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in returns closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st near Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adjusted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the U.S. will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial increase in interest , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet out@@ performed companies with weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are losing the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure equity matches , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says parliamentary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ fi@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly reluct@@ ant to distinguish commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; EP colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ law radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishes itself from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC general director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire for the commercial ri@@ vals to tramp@@ le on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced &quot; in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wished that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it started the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order of further rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee collectors for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down issues
for over a decade virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , such as at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes , and we will probably see that the growth will decrease .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event occurring on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe Black Friday , in which buyers fight for bar@@ gains , can prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of 5 pounds of expenditure a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
some products , such as TVs and washing machines , are now being carried out over a third of the purchases via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the mo@@ ats in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca through the streets .
Saudi Arabia de@@ parts the breakdown of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ p .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the track to declare their respect , when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning proc@@ essions pass by the holy place , where only days before , a crane ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell onto the worshi@@ ppers .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king had imposed a san@@ ction on the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have let the arm of the crane stop when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , falling into an inner courtyard of the mo@@ b , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which was held later this month .
the Bin Laden group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque as part of the massive construction led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a ren@@ eg@@ ade son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe has stepped up
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q stores will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is alleged that the British set down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , it seems to be a minority today .
the British increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , thus the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction market chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , offering services at deep prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 retail outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the regional court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted in May by this accus@@ ation .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants used funds from members of the association , through which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of financial dec@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact divided the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen from the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials had only comp@@ uted expenses for allowance and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we carry on the club or lock us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants told , in the bre@@ wing profession , large @-@ scale inspec@@ tors of the financial calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with the assumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed with : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts .
furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance compens@@ ations was passed retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allowance exp@@ ences was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an increase in the account had been paid out .
therefore , package and not detailed bookings seemed to occur , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and savings dic@@ tion@@ aries jointly administered the two accused , the second accused .
the judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is not interested in the details of the financial regulation , it is important that the freedom of debt has been important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the accused explained .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation claim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claims compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor want to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With that you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he just calculated mile@@ age and di@@ eting .
he charged the association 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documentation for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
these were no longer kept after an operating audit , in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to o@@ dom@@ eter money .
he explained in his statement that all de@@ port@@ ations were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his place of residence on the international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard prints more 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ Sto@@ ese will have further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions of the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around € 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the quar@@ terly breakdown of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share tra@@ ded by 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , sp@@ li@@ ts at the moment : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separately from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business divisions are to be quoted on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers for his services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under USD 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds to the change in the industry by split@@ ting up and massive mile@@ stones .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and more and more businesses do the same online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the disman@@ tling of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct involvement of German soldiers in hostili@@ ties in Iraq , however , would predominantly hit rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
by contrast , 24 per cent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed reject a cooperation with the Syrian rulers of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , while 20 percent would be .
29 per cent couldn &apos;t decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the centre of the fair , connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International automobile exhibition under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility unites &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A of Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA auto association reck@@ on with around 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and a water @-@ laun@@ cher against several hundred put @-@ on refugees .
D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had been formed and a water ej@@ ector was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially used pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokesman of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank arrives two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , was that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will hold from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed earned interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior member of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds are good against such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
De@@ ath@@ ar@@ ist at the Delta State University left sorry to write sorry
after firing and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it impossible , &quot; announced authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb was not an explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday who supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb ph@@ oned relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a PhD title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely requires his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrading the che@@ et@@ akers of Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the management team around chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
in the future , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ controlled strike on that Thursday .
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , cockpit wants to come as quickly as possible with a predicted record result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , the conflict between the union and airline has led to various strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is clear that the Lufthansa in the fight against competitors is shifting to the Group &apos;s own cheap credit line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this caused the left outer defense to cry and to exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before it was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bone frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee was wrong .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack on both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United won the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V defeat
the UK def@@ enders launched an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about that .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is better acquainted with The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ el published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read from my children because it always seems to give a picture or message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead re@@ produces a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel lived and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
despite the fact that he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the curious , trees fal@@ low , Th@@ need stri@@ cken Once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
pushing for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der , whom England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batch arrangement , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack .
here @-@ based news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England test squ@@ ad and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to om@@ it Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , because - and I said this - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th had been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even though he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set Jonathan de@@ fi@@ ance in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in , and he &apos;s a drummer whom I set up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and would get 4 Qui@@ cks@@ acks , di@@ ved up , and I didn &apos;t mind about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed person has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might have completed his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred rings and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the ca@@ des as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup @-@ spinning players who raise their hands and the trainers decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dian , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what is said before .

the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = UK exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy reaches a sl@@ um@@ ber by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will go deeper every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who viol@@ ently fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European Diplom@@ ate friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on its own debt , Britain itself created agenda with budget@@ ary concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes , which they mostly do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European boy@@ friend , wishing for a UK @-@ looking Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and reveals that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long periods such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or sub@@ stitution in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain is a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of them have similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies .
therefore , some such ministers are inten@@ tional not planning helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press microphones , as they did during the 1975 referendum that inspired Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the arch @-@ euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ins@@ an@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ hack@@ ers ali@@ ens and the non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but noticed that when sitting in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , better ban@@ anas were distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of being lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir itself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ passed constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly hook on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ouse trend and wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everybody .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not ad@@ mitting that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV all around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he substanti@@ ates his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ criteria Dec@@ ision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) model to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to obtain according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not provided , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco bat@@ ons of P@@ he took part .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote the research work of the group that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria . &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims made by BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are far less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to this , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by creating clear evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ man , says former boss of Channel 4
the chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least make your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as wide a support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why an reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ man is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be a public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC altogether .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who directed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts show that the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , featured in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their hypo@@ critical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio charge Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think all , we all think that one receives a great deal for £ 150 a year here , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify , &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example of this in &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and deal with the commercial channels alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by break@@ outs of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ az@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms generally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic air bubbles .
the bubbles found it out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ onic to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor @-@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic hes@@ it@@ ant corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger by the blu@@ ff with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entry into student resi@@ dences is ranging from mild nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ jahr , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly , Mar@@ mite do not love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ ited and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and get their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friends close by baking .
since you start the university at the peak of back man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and at the end maybe associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad bl@@ ended l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the milk producer .
the chances are good that they say they are serving themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a washing up liquid to her milk to punish the thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my corridor was asking her neighbors if they had something to make Drum &amp; Bass more quiet because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she closed her own music , shut up her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , get rid of them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps see how she moves all together friends .
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never fail someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the blanket no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how one can still build cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will drive to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay here for a large part .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need enough living space over the next few decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ aries : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of housing .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
mer@@ cen@@ ary : I used my project correctly .
what makes it particularly complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ verordnung regulation .
large @-@ scale .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three flats in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show how one can build still today cheap and well .

iOS 9 : how to Get the New iPhone Operating System when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more prob@@ able by adding the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple won &apos;t admit that the update will continue as the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to a dis@@ continuation of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; was founded three months ago and has joined another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which Alfred Klein took the lead .
this makes it possible to include chess players , who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the Schach@@ club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the centre of the old people Anton@@ ín have joined forces under the clo@@ ak of the social foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
besides consultations , one can also take part in courses there .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the inner city .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seeking information on questions such as health care insurance or services of the health and nursing staff are available immediately .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ essing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many services of the insur@@ ances are not seldom taken into consideration because the complexity of insurance policies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business unit and for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic shift .
for this , a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future is essential .
moreover , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation ceremony . &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alizing . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent as possible in their familiar environment as quickly as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 : 00 a.m. to 12 : 00 p.m .

ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was un@@ impressed in Bremen .
foot@@ ball@@ ers were once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and near Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim was engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he plans to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years .
on the other hand , he has not attached intellectu@@ ally .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the Bremen city , when he saw a park @-@ room gu@@ ardian put out a bal@@ lot for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Wiese was stor@@ med out of the business , offen@@ ded the obj@@ ec@@ tin , and threw it in front of the feet , as reported by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether the meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beating up to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police details of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
three persons were also held on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the youth and struck the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al her@@ nia and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he let off his sacrifice first .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the cul@@ pri@@ t followed the group with a car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times .
when you no longer saw the car , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , one exam@@ pled the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue T@@ estim@@ ony is present .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ interrup@@ ts .
also , vel@@ vet may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ ul are also happy .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side for his successor over the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller re@@ opens its practice on October 12 , where he will invest EUR 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the men met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who now completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice ann@@ ot@@ ated year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ u@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mil@@ ler couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss as soon as possible .
and so they agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in the DRC &apos;s prepar@@ edness in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of 19 September , the office will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ is@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros in the context of a funding program of the County ( 25,000 euros ) as well as by the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice for every quarter , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in North German average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ auses .
if no follow@@ er had found himself , she would have gone too .
inci@@ dentally , anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultations , also looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock faces .
with their par@@ ting in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ burger recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she felt a little sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I &apos;ve always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister for Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia wash@@ es down &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia hopes to continue travelling to Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already severely controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia hopes that Slovenia will not seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to arrive in eastern Croatia by crossing the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have ever been meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is predominantly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country will be counting about 4,000 refugees , said interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were diver@@ ted to Croatia by the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night away from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border crossing from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has done so , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west route could now be expected to be postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since then the EU partners have consistently delivered a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm early Wednesday at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he is keeping the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large tables each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy made this action aware of its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is quite familiar with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy also provides the pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and talks as well as the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously joins the chal@@ k and re@@ plen@@ ishes the sentence &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can &quot; read &quot; the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long &quot; comple@@ ments , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , little discussions about the action are developing , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that eventually the end of this world comes to me , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Mannheim church , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ er of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective promotion of the 20 year old is good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that not everyone wants to publi@@ ci@@ ze themselves on the boards is understandable , but after all , it is a very personal thing .
the theme of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement has contributed much to the opening of people in recent years .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ dienst is free and con@@ fession@@ al .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Corporation said to make a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that will end next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts predicted a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view is , despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective January 4 and despite higher allow@@ ances for ground transport of heavy and large packages , which are raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue , and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below € 2.@@ 44 per share , which analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts asked six analysts at $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , the company &apos;s turnover increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices while the result dropped because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time in almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is lo@@ oming over them at the end of the two @-@ story sitting hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation to all other matters .
the Central Bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it is announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most data in the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and whether it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Berat@@ ende &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average rose by 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy su@@ stains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would have to go very far in its explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world ended up in the end of the month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the D@@ ow being now almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market tur@@ mo@@ il affect the complex calculation when the interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better under control .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in its decision @-@ making .
but in effect , the F@@ ed has become the world &apos;s currency authority .
the influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere mention of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion &quot; caused confusion around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also deal with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements associated with seemingly not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raise interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives rolled back these cuts .
the F@@ ed should first place aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the Br@@ ing of the Mark@@ s in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England &apos;s Inter@@ est Sec@@ ret@@ ariat .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think it should take the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still fond of teaching with her 74 lic@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from a proper school .
Brazilian Pap@@ di@@ at@@ rical Society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn of the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the completed building instruction was unanim@@ ously agreed without any major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee had previously adopted an application for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ current first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof surface for solar installations is the background of the planning : &quot; this is how we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; there was again the roof ti@@ lt , which for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - should lie below ten degrees .
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the slope of the roof did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereas the Bern@@ ese rule is usually rather restric@@ tive for exemp@@ tion applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ out is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the cost is approximately 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band promotion .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will be submitted to the District Office for review .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the tra@@ itor Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the continued In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and went to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside station .
for the next two years Fischer should work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ ap@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is to be permanently closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the District Court had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Clinic has been completed .
district Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the federal government , should hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property progres@@ ses , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was unable to say that there were several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short term care for Car@@ itas and a daily sp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , did not exist .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion is required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .

Jag@@ rob@@ inia with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( County Wit@@ tenberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police told .
after a shot , a 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the crime police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect brought the police to the body of the 16 year old boy from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 year old admitted that the teenagers were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police par@@ ted on Wednesday .
also on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , was charged with the fact that the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after arriving home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially stum@@ bled upon personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally revealed .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ rator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 year old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation is to be made clear of the circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a pay@@ able lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution campaigns on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens about the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Socialist residential building &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as a asylum seek@@ er in an initial accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were available for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable savings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a budget deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0.000 living units have already been missing in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , compla@@ ins Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many working people lived in big cities not@@ e@@ worthy in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a longer time because of the sl@@ um@@ ber on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; proposes a re @-@ launch .
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
in this way , the transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax on subsidi@@ zed flats can be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee accommodation at the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros had already been set up on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free ra@@ ids : Croatia and Slovenia establish a corridor
there is practically no coming through to Hungary , since more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces the granting of transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the death of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which came into force on the same day also make decent asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia .
at the Cro@@ at @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
the border zone har@@ bors a number of other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police en@@ umer@@ ated 3@@ 66 individuals .
shortly before closing the gates on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convi@@ ctions are threatening prison sentences of up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important passage in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
locking grids were disman@@ tled and one of the host camps in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves at the end of this reconstruction .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only reaching a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions issued by German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set up rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the stream of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and rounded off the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first su@@ ck@@ led the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said right away , we bring it to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u . after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , it was still possible to attempt to cross the border .
but the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ ably sporty , day before a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially praised the Hungarian government &apos;s stance in the dun@@ gh@@ ill region of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the fron@@ tier regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands to do with the spreading of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first @-@ time reception centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got hold of Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was carried out without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meister@@ werk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 copies in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without a ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial administrators .
they would have assured him of creating districts for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supporting Konrad .
in the morning , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily arrange accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of need , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ s have to respect a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the upper hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad reasons with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into your face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier no cost the Republic as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the own quest for lodging has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz in the office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected are currently not able to take these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in case of an emergency , however , other locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city chief on the partition of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a prolonged telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday records the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the investig@@ ators , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ stir@@ s once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is again carrying out controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er says a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I was thinking long if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Greater Region that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her fashion interest , Br@@ eit gave birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert can &apos;t answer with the last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag is used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign @-@ hostile manner , reveals journalists or reveal gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire date .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant town is related to him over nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native city judge shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , to whom Tr@@ ump also belongs to the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , there is also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the investors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
real estate company foundations were the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once he@@ wn off without permission , the director of the Institute for P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma was a born junk , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker reti@@ res the Americans rather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm , like some K@@ all@@ y@@ stad@@ ters , men@@ tions that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ sk@@ eer Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie @-@ go@@ ers , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the liber@@ als &apos; leadership , but there has been no major shifts in Today &apos;s evaluations .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull stri@@ pped the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand@@ ings didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared with today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today reported a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , Today we reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September , Sun@@ rise was at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at Today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning min@@ ers more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial line of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ i star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL &apos;s Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour a full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the ratings of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a sub@@ stitution for a million dollars that failed to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
reveal secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ wel@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably unknow@@ ingly have revealed who wins the b@@ achel@@ or .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three girls left will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows a day before coming out of three two , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women in a ly@@ rical way have left out why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game corruption , who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ ther &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ki as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ted at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a punch return and also to the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his stu@@ d@@ ded catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters away as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more agile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence erup@@ ted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of you throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said that the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent disputes since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be reconstructed .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ floor area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den , the city of Em@@ den , wants to market a land of some 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for corresponding offers , it is said on the part of the city .
which investor do not come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the land , which is located on the ring road / corner Great Street , bought already a few months ago and had the buildings torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure activities
for months past closed doors were negotiated , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project , which is around ten to twelve million euros , has been under discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ ds that had come to the meeting called forth the pictures and new details about the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the stak@@ ing assignment of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ comes all other don@@ keys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like several other project critics , he fears that traffic will increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ loads must come , so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google to start dou@@ bling donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to the publication of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / are doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which drove more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
coverage of Yas@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery are longer living than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity has proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a BM@@ I body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach upset - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
in the meantime , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgery , 36 % of the diabetes condition disappeared completely and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was reduced completely by only one percent and partly only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , reflecting the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , said the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , with larger out@@ ings in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and posted a complete over@@ haul of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent an Adi@@ posit@@ as operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is currently being increasingly noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ loved at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved those problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resol@@ ving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swallow heavily alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ sing agents , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the toxic control centers report , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children disinf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in social media .
video on YouTube shows how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry odor@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency department .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the twin Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah wa@@ its her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them over night in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ aries and store hand des@@ infection products outside the reach of the child .
in addition , over alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained toxic , un@@ declared ingredients .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by out@@ lining anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pu@@ zz@@ iness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area and was too late to notice that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ involved vehicles , a damage of about 10,000 euros was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer running and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons created a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays a talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bor@@ dering Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic fans because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed by a five @-@ point advantage at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it this way - but we have to go on .
we really need Celtic support because that makes the players better .
standing up now is so important .

S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the fall from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts passed 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later aboli@@ shed - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insisted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not question integrity , I did not comment on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swear to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts via Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; it is certain that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice &apos;s Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management board still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but confess that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton &apos;s policies to win a seventh consecutive League victory , bringing them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while overall rising in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the process
as the security guards couldn &apos;t bring peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stur@@ geon in custody .
a alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 per mil@@ le and remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except in late legal action , I will see a man being brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in an audience gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ases persu@@ ade him to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale poli@@ ten@@ ess remained dry when he talked the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a house peace event in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t @-@ t@@ amp@@ on test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk through the head raised , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had conducted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his st@@ ables .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they evidently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should surely grasp their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will become personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L acted cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there think that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate myself , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching meant that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the troubled Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack had been applied to the horse &apos;s legs , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly applied slu@@ dge to the leg .
it could have been that night last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it had been so on the race day too .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats out against ri@@ vals for alle@@ gations of w@@ rest@@ ling
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring@@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett did an almost cover@@ t note to the Storm team after his team achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy was defending the torch of his crew and said that she was only focused on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when she beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real center of gravity , and that has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is already funny , as this always appears at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premi@@ ership in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a divorce suit .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them at a stage .
the Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final final in A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guaran@@ tee on Dru@@ gs
a man who might have a life @-@ long punishment for his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota sound .
despite a potentially life @-@ length penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café might have been from a harmless foundation .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ able declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he wai@@ ves his Australian and his Serbian passport , registers with the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cabin torn apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved were bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told him .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing driver tore apart completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 p.m .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to attract ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and he &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with that .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to viol@@ ating the charges of diso@@ be@@ ying children on 14 June last year and not to have appeared before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was found in his arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael shifted the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are caught off the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers lost people at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn in the coun@@ ties of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic @-@ guns to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded for registration .
a lot more refugees arrived at Munich &apos;s main railway station in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokesman in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : predecessor of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected in the south @-@ west &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden especially .
according to DW@@ D , it is even Thursday night in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with arches of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday we can see the sun again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is above all a movement among the compact cars that are particularly well @-@ selling at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations have been accounted for by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( Audi@@ ence Days 17th to 27th September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the largest Premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel provides an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , starting at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the H@@ essi@@ ans also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A and new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the early next year , and then as a Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan van wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
however , there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki So@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , among them a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .

the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison facility Te@@ gel , which was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
those affected may even hope for money if they were confined to confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man who is now again on a free foot according to his lawyer was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant , due to the un@@ worthy conditions of confin@@ ement against the country of Berlin , failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and re@@ mitted the case to the re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity wounded .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for repar@@ ations were decisive , there was a compensation claim , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a worsen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of imprisonment .
so they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had att@@ ested to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in Karlsruhe &apos;s case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit head@@ lines in recent weeks due to missing staff .
therefore , det@@ ain@@ ees are included again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets it is supposed to have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied in Te@@ gel because of the lack of offspring , 19 are to drop away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to mind in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) ap@@ partements annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , especially with affordable rental properties : annually , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social dwell@@ ings are coming out of the rental price , and refugees are also able to apply for these particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is seen from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that over the long term 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residence requirement that limit asylum seekers to a residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the perspective prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s way to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for their parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sche@@ de , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management hand@@ outs are distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcoming classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ range from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , the interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its stance .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ dung receive no benefits after the asylum application act , if they start a study .
the latter basically don &apos;t get any b@@ af@@ o@@ ads , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ gi .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany four years so far in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span shor@@ tens to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively clear the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
the foundation of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important .
rights also include duties .
in this way , representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control options .
this is also part of the prepar@@ edness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be a lot more than today a topic of the whole of society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this the majority society will have to change , the disman@@ tling of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination office and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the non @-@ white German advoc@@ acy groups have long requested and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the refugees that have been expected so far , &quot; says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery demands to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers right away from the registration of health cards .
services provided may later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to scrap so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application act provides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors make especially the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are becoming po@@ orer of their illnesses than other patients .
interpre@@ ting costs should not only be taken over in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , they request .
many refugees would be helped by more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV education .
with some other illnesses , German doctors come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , even relief may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practise , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass tests .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psych@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) . most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Munich Technical University shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attack and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong vi@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z .
up to now only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can request a psycho@@ therapy application in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , mostly non @-@ personnel workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to attract all age groups under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal hus@@ bands and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Celeb@@ ration invites you to dream in the man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is Circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current issue of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for the lovers is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can@@ teen cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to take hold of the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and agi@@ lity - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous Sal@@ mon Sal@@ ves , the cir@@ cus ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ tip feel and articul@@ ation .
balance with the imp@@ eller on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake men are fascinated and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often a topic with different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every pet@@ ting unit has about 80 animals from five different continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege .
the first commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 people , we always give our best and are with my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had pro@@ fan@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gab@@ it &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the concerned Parliament members that immunity will end in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will forward the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing so far un@@ available , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to address the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the match against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is surely still uncertain at the European Championship .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in touch with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have caused most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb prior to playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger places a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and is driven by far @-@ away hopes to lead the association to its first European Capital triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out in Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 @-@ 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation is domin@@ ating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy fortune .
the beautiful thing about Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and end@@ anger myself is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ sider status may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed cou@@ lis@@ se to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to comedy Central from beginning to end - the total of 2@@ 36 episodes - for # friendship festival
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
during his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will be helping PS@@ G to drop by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as the PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they are not only seeking qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to create problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team on the weekend to hold a 2 : 2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed away nicely into the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field , a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps poles in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the offensive .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes appeared , with some failures and bad degrees , last but not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five trials and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . in this way , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great play of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
just a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league champion , four times champion league champion , two times European champion , twice European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Madrid won everything , we do nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ bl@@ ig wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
commemor@@ ating : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the Bayern Munich .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça subscri@@ bed to Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have been running with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown was defeated by emphas@@ ising the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the actors from The Mar@@ tian confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nun beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People was nominated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 libraries since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement had a country@@ wide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured preservation .
in February Prince Prince launched a recording of the year &apos;s nom@@ ine@@ es during the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News figure , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all the steps of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the fin@@ als .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge at full three seconds faster which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac D ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great grat@@ efulness .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have some gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same when they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once upon a time they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins paid a chance to as@@ cen@@ sion within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word which was difficult to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Del@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then in sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine matches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
design@@ ate Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at his ( kick training ) , saw clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to return to the game again .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy &apos;s left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run into the right @-@ h@@ anders Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finish run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third ba@@ z@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play .
it was the 27th install@@ ment of the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe played a double play
after bringing an insurance @-@ run to Detroit at the end of the ninth inning , the Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been d@@ ashed against the game of the vulner@@ ability list after losing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started to feel that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ ow @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z aboli@@ shed his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , created another Run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers scored a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from center @-@ fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ shoul@@ ders .
he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder strap , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list in order to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since August 20th .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of Refu@@ ge@@ es Sh@@ ould Under@@ stand in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people of Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden was sharing on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian State Capital have been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they will then be further distributed to other communities .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse according to the government presi@@ dency of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective bar@@ gaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is approaching our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has again set up controls on its southern and eastern borders .
on Tuesday evening , Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening that no one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany too did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not name concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann and several other EU heads of state and government applied for a special summit next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of additional 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this jointly with the countries , announced Merkel at the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the prime ministers in the Chanc@@ ellery of Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would also depl@@ ore this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be locked with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from looking for alternative routes via Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants have gone on the path to the Greek border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the ro@@ log@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ appa En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ lashes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclude this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the moon is easy on its path around the ring planets .
this movement of de@@ af@@ ness is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ ies water vap@@ our and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
the extent of the hidden ocean has , however , not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must abst@@ ain about a month at the open @-@ stage actor Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation has resulted in a reduction in ad@@ duc@@ tor injuries to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis means &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties presented a Def@@ en@@ siv@@ mann as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was recently active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
goal keeper Ru@@ bin Ok@@ ot@@ ie is able to return to the team again next week after his bra@@ ins .
the Austrian National Player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured her head in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious fault .
no fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ gos contain much vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
during purchase , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .

first fo@@ e storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord side of the F@@ öhn through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer partly blows through the fo@@ eh@@ n @-@ herd with storm @-@ strength .
on Thursday morning we will cross a marked cold front which brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure region over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the north side of the Alps , on the night of Wednesday , the fo@@ eh@@ n falls through the valleys .
until Thursday morning , the F@@ öhn blows in the f@@ ables with bu@@ cks from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can reach into the adjacent middle of the middle and even Or@@ kan@@ ians from over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , the moisture begins to accumulate at the slope .
here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday night .
in sum , in the next 48 hours , in the south of the Alps , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the next 48 hours , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn blows the air , as a result , a cold front with a powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east is rolling through Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind picks up strong and stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly return .
the following days , in the north , present in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , while in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin Luther square
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing had been applied for by the working community of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries .
with this place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he then perceived the city as a deca@@ ying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the Ab@@ las@@ h@@ andel .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motives his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles which dedic@@ ate themselves to topics like cru@@ ises , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
so he has fascinated several partners immediately : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who deals with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current contex@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry belt has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately utter triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on it , in order to be able to carry on with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to make art more important in a fast @-@ pac@@ ed period : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by an advertisement , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to immer@@ se himself in the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he can understand life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not take care not to completely capture the Bible , but chose the most important and mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the images , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this work is an invitation to Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail draws near
plans were made , companies were commissioned , soil moun@@ ts for a circular course were model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration cared for dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill pe@@ eled , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was made in October , the first community @-@ mate Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should start without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its engagement for refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga begins a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been keeping this as the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B Chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; declared Nier@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some of the federal states also support this program .
this weekend , the 36 professionals will mark a clear sign when they will wear the &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ en Motorsport Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can say no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup Final on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their own places is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called off all the money for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief executive of SAP loses an eye on an accident
the head of the head of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost sight of the left eye by a fall at the beginning of July .
in the event of an accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight , he fell on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , took him out into the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to wake up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered an appropriate picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel .
this is why during the night race in Singapore he is just as little as a reservation driver for the two Stam@@ b@@ ill@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
D@@ ö@@ bör@@ h@@ eg@@ y : renovated rural house at the edge of the forest
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group match of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be absent from the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ ush will be back in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
due to the high load of his pros , Tu@@ chel is not only able to change his pedi@@ gre@@ es on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the goal keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of master @-@ keepers Roman bür@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
in probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ceful statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , says Mittel@@ feld@@ bru@@ Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be technological pioneer following the German government &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic jams , &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use itself internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Transport Policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the Germans , however , still look scep@@ tical about cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , and 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed expect to be up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following an acquisition of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the whole trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , any fourth would not leave the car in control under any circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
after the current stand at the title battles of 25 September to 4 October , the Düsseldorf group wants to only open in singles .
the final decision should be made by the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European semester in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship mine in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared individual European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the net list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League match at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven the defender was hit at a tac@@ kling of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and changed after a long time of treatment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look sho@@ ck@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just fine clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits provide an insight into the barely visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ st the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the Senator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the October fest , there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , agile fashion tries of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first show of fashion .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machine in and around P@@ lau@@ en was about making metres .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were created in large quantities for customers , for example , they worked on blankets and curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work any more , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ vies .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt shares some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fashion , which leans against past bull po@@ ds , represents an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already handle half of all orders .
Mo@@ lit@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there are almost no private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
nowadays the mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively distributed over chains .
moreover , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer declares from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been running a quality seal for this year which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schne@@ e@@ berger Regional Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the University of Applied Arts in Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for applied art - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ikes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which must first of all have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .

the pl@@ um gol@@ ds@@ mith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from this : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who wish to commemor@@ ate a commemor@@ ative piece .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace .

legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first movie with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the n@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI ur@@ ges the economy to open more widely to the world
the economy must open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group charged with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the management board has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market more open , said the statement .
the government will also ease checks on powers transferred to the company and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus to increase consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; higher dose of the tox@@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limits of the nerve @-@ pois@@ oning for large fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons . &quot;
large predat@@ or fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they are already adher@@ ing to the planned high values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low volumes can cause very low levels of damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its website with regard to the current maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants receive more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crossed permanently &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
