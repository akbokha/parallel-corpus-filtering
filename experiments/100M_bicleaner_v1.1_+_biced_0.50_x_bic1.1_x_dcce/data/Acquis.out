&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to determine the procedure to be applied when carrying out the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the objective of the method of securing measures laid down in this agreement is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a junction using the risk of early detection .
for the submission of the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of time , stating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out its investigations , the organization makes full use of the safety system of the Community after article 3 full use .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this agreement is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the use of their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and policies of the following type and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures for the assessment of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that points out the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone and the changes in the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the organization in line with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , has not yet been established in the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The safety precau@@ tions provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , which is temporarily not possible or desirable in Article 11 , is to consult the organization and the community about the use of appropriate security measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13 , unless the organization and the community consent to the fact that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities than sensors in instruments ;
B ) ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═ ═
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organisation liber@@ ates the core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to the Convention , from these security measures , unless the core material quantity liberated in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of very special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ anium enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the principal material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to , processed or stored in accordance with this agreement , provisions for re @-@ application of the securing measures are made on the material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organisation &apos;s tasks are successful and effective in accordance with this Convention , in particular , as to how the procedures set out in the Convention are applicable .
supplementary agreements may be extended or modified without alter@@ ing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the agreement ; an extension of this period requires a take @-@ action between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report , the organization maintains a consolidated Invent@@ ory of the entire core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory by following the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
in succ@@ eeding GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is hin@@ dered by general resource handling problems .
C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC &apos;s organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement .
the organisation establishes a special account under the name &quot; special transaction account &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is kept separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which at demand in the currency of the respective state to pay in order of the organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the fee will be made within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the deadline required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
the car@@ et@@ aker , according to the usual procedure of the organization , takes approximately proportional drawing to the cash or the school Notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be governed by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further bor@@ rowing capacity to loan terms without dis@@ cour@@ agement ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned may be governed by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is intended to fund a clearly defined and rapidly re@@ payable development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s lending program or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and administered by the organization funded by the Organisation ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of decent funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which are bound by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in ten free @-@ years each in 50 years .
a special transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the benef@@ ici@@ ary country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
revenues from each transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced . ( i ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to the extent of which the car@@ et@@ aker determined at the time of the loan granted , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments made by a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC about the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation and via the projects approved by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of a special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose .
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor &apos;s external audi@@ tor .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will soon provide a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction .
the administrator creates and manages appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are determined by the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker operate closely together in order to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction account will have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement does not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the E@@ EC and the Organization may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total capital amount of all the benef@@ ici@@ aries received from the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are terminated .
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the general sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ General heads these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of the Agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two tran@@ scriptions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with any wor@@ ding being binding .

the agreements could be closed down to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future pro@@ visi@@ oning fund of member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned here@@ after , for whose application the B@@ IS would be ready .
at any stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without being over@@ stepped in a total of five years .
at the opening of the credits as well as for its possible extension , the B@@ IS would charge a loan opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw should not be made before the end of a month following the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the B@@ IS applied at the time to under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the B@@ IS had to obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate to be applied could achieve a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor elevated to a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to share with you the approval of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic about trading with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ case weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure a faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the actual annual volume does not exceed the agreed amount and / or is executed in accordance with the usual offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .

the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the joint market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the sales of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the regulation of the regulation to under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community hereby agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only be given at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agre@@ ements .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that there are amounts of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of the Ö@@ stlich des Uruguay on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I honour myself to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or ch@@ illed chicken - lamb - and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen chicken - lamb - and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure a faul@@ tless functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the actual annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes up the safeguard clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans &apos; access to the common market has not been affected by this agreement .
in case the imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community comm@@ its itself to conf@@ ine the de@@ ple@@ tion to imports of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set under number 2 according to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be established in accordance with the regulations of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall take account of the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is set to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of the Greek accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat in frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sale of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin due to the regulation of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community hereby agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will only be given at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .

the Secretary @-@ General also noti@@ fies the European Economic Community any action , notification or notification in connection with this Convention .
considering that it is highly desirable , if Member States support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in obtaining re@@ agents for blood group determination ,
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are subject to the regulations set up jointly by the Member States , and the necessary facilities and exemp@@ tions for their import@@ ation are granted -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of this agreement , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin to blood group determination and to determine blood intoler@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this convention on re@@ agents of human origin to blood group determination by signing this agreement or the backing of its rati@@ fication , approval or membership certificate by a statement directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration may be taken back at any time by a Noti@@ fication aimed at the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the contracting parties undertake to provide re@@ agents for blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of costs of their extraction , preparation and promotion , as well as the purchase price of other contracting parties , if they themselves have sufficient reserves for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other contracting parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with that they are only used for medical purposes and designated only by the governments involved .
each shipment of re@@ agents for blood type determination must be accompanied by a certificate that they have been established in accordance with the protocol regulations .
the Protocol and its establishment constitute an administrative agreement which may be amended or amended by the governments of the contractual parties of this convention .

any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with a notice to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe under a notice period of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all the tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is homo@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um@@ di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively to the volume of the blood cell flow in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on slides , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and standards developed for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity at the time .
according to the definition , an international standard supplement contains a certain number of international units per m@@ g. or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational sti@@ g@@ ma , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ fusion .
the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the title ration of unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sciss@@ ors contain 256 international units per ml per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FIL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the testing period ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ ous pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin to blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ ffy or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain any sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood group determination should not be artificial artisti@@ cally , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are distributed in such a manner and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount inside a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to conduct written records on all stages and controls of the re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents issued can be stored in the laboratory for a long time , until a certain probability can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups based on their effective share .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
it is possible to attach a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re @-@ dissolution ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions enclosed in the containers include the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re @-@ dissolution ,
each shipment must be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .

the forms associated with the goods transport between the contracting parties are fu@@ eled by a single api@@ er to apply for the prints according to the samples in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .
the single paper is used as a registration or paper for export , shipment or import@@ ation .
- for the implementation of legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed by the sole use of the single @-@ party ;
- requested by the parties involved in order to make it possible for them to enjoy a part or a certain relief .

in these cases , it is necessary to submit a registration at which it can act with the consent of the competent authorities in order to act periodi@@ cally , within the deadline established by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be permitted to use trading documents instead of the single document .
if the consistency @-@ paper is used , the parties with the consent of the relevant authorities may contribute to the adoption of all the associated for@@ war@@ ms related to export and imports instead of the supplements to the Single @-@ paper in the trade , in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the forms of transportation for their entire goods traffic or for sub @-@ sectors ;

- allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant for@@ esters in their data processing systems for the treatment of registr@@ ations , and , if necessary , without a written registration ;

- App@@ li@@ ances that have been adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee on the way of a decision under Article 11 paragraph 3 .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 may not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective sub@@ missions , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the provisions for the export and the dispatch process must be based on the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these for@@ esters .
in the cases of article 7 , the competent authorities are in agreement as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings shall be consistent .
( 1 ) To ensure a smooth exchange of goods between the contracting parties and facilit@@ ating the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , customs authorities of these countries place each other on request or - if they are interested in another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The minist@@ erial aid may be denied or refused , if the desired country of view is that the administrative assistance would interfere with its security , public order ( or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , commercial or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the case of refusal or refusal of the minist@@ erial aid , the corresponding decision and its grounds for the seeking country must be communicated un@@ condition@@ ally .
