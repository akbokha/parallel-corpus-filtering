<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the agreement is to determine the procedure to be applied when carrying out the provisions of Part I on securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The objective of the method of securing measures laid down in this agreement is the timely discovery of the branching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes as well as deterrence from such a junction using the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">For the submission of the target specified in Article 28, the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, fading with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of time, stating the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out its investigations, the organization makes full use of the safety system of the Community after article 3 full use.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the community for nuclear materials in accordance with this agreement is based on an outline in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the use of their security measures, the Community will make use of de procedures and policies of the following type and, as far as necessary, foresee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved, manufactured, lost, lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities;</seg>

<seg id="708">H) Procedure for reporting to the organization in line with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, has not yet been established in the States, so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, unless it is introduced for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves core material suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safety precautions provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. however, if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material, which is temporarily not possible or desirable in Article 11, is to consult the organization and the community about the use of appropriate security measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The security measures envisaged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13, unless the organization and the community consent to the fact that this core material is practically non-refundable.</seg>

<seg id="724">If the principal material is to be processed or stored together with the core material, which is subject to, processed or stored in accordance with this agreement, provisions for re-application of the securing measures are made on the material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements, which are necessary to determine the extent to which the organisation's tasks are successful and effective in accordance with this Convention, in particular, as to how the procedures set out in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">Supplementary agreements may be extended or modified without altering this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of the agreement; an extension of this period requires a take-action between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">Based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 of the initial report, the organization maintains a consolidated Inventory of the entire core material in the states, irrespective of its origin, and carries out this inventory by following the following reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">In succeeding GRÜNDE - a) EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is hindered by general resource handling problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the EEC's organisation has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation establishes a special account under the name "special transaction account" which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "steward"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is kept separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which at demand in the currency of the respective state to pay in order of the organization as an administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the fee will be made within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadline required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">The caretaker, according to the usual procedure of the organization, takes approximately proportional drawing to the cash or the school Notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be governed by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further borrowing capacity to loan terms without discouragement; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned may be governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is intended to fund a clearly defined and rapidly repayable development programme or project (including a sectoral project), irrespective of whether it is part of the organisation's lending program or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and administered by the organization funded by the Organisation (b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of decent funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization, which are bound by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in ten free-years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">A special transaction loan is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the beneficiary country and the caretaker, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from each transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced. (i) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to the extent of which the caretaker determined at the time of the loan granted, could be the recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments made by a special transaction loan are made on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC about the projects and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation and via the projects approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of a special transaction loan and the expenses made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor's external auditor.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC will soon provide a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and manages appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are determined by the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker operate closely together in order to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction account will have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions, and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement does not come into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the EEC and the Organization may agree, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total capital amount of all the beneficiaries received from the recipients in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are terminated.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States note the general secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretary-General heads these notifications along with a Notification on the proper approval of the Agreement by the EEC to the organization.</seg>
