this document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ P ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. C@@ wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things which are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ setting ) alternate with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes associated with the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are at the same time taking other medicines which are removed just as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the brain activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness using the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with injection solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those receiving placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms in four of the five short @-@ term studies to treat bi@@ polar disorder .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks , and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to placebo , and were similar to lor@@ dosis .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal dys@@ functions ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , se@@ dation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company &quot; Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot; a permit for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with respect to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide associated with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , transmission problems ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , have to be removed .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l had increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ phen@@ es , poly@@ phen@@ ols , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to comb@@ o @-@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
considering the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dos@@ ages should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose levels prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy may be accounted for with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ lic concentrations .
doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ om@@ orph@@ an / 3 method xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treating with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
because of the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l showed a lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ xy@@ lic treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with cervical treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ xy@@ lic treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters oc@@ cured , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ at@@ ase ) , in general temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older Dem@@ enti@@ a patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes M@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dosage with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma antibody .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 receptor and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
intraven@@ ous emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ts .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operation @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of the respon@@ dent patients , who had a response to the study media , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ f@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ ages defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ f@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher rate of recur@@ rence rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ surgery in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium and semi @-@ surgery .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination rate is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l for extensive metabol@@ isi@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impact of liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the potential carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle ste@@ aling state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( ranging from 1 to 3@@ fold to mean dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in human limbs at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the medium steady state AU@@ C at the recommended maximum dose .

84 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l , the treatment should be continued with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events involving patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy may be accounted for with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ lic concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 receptor and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablets in healthy subjects , the ratio of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l hydro@@ xy@@ lic metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( from 1 to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the medium steady state AU@@ C at the recommended maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the resor@@ ption and to minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under the circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ab@@ norm@@ alities ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , transmission problems ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ phen@@ es , poly@@ phen@@ ols , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after a certain application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers applied Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) as one @-@ off charge in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular and who received lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular at the same time .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites can result in the common application of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dos@@ ages should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose levels prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after some gift from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ xy@@ lic treatment was 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ xy@@ lic treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters oc@@ cured , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects reported in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances were the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater enh@@ ancements of ag@@ gi@@ ci@@ ousness / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ousness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement from initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ousness , a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operation @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of the respon@@ dent patients , who had a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( aria pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % .
current values from Mess@@ ages defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ f@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , less patients achieved an increase of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ vot@@ zo@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ magni@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after injection of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ q@@ zo@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; this means that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l hydro@@ xy@@ lic metabol@@ ites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times of the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose or 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits following dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the medi@@ al steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer took part , of which about three quarters were previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane were able to respond to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if one considers only the patients treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators showed that Abra@@ x@@ anes was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low or low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines there is no need to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane across the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ based therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there are no studies in patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients , no further abrasion treatment cycles should be induced until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ane number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ sives .
while a clearly related car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women of child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to leave no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sper@@ mac@@ er@@ vation prior to the treatment , as the treatment with abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) , which can affect transport efficiency and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events occurring in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ anes as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stool , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of the muscles , head@@ aches , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness , Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an An@@ tim@@ ised rot@@ ub@@ ules , which promotes the co@@ ag@@ ulation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ ol@@ ym@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ sing @-@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ receptor and , due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanim@@ ous untreated trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to finish on Bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ anes with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active substance exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After receiving an intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 26@@ 0@@ mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high volume of distribution points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or partial binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher in abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average for cum@@ ulative urine leak@@ age was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogenic agent and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile injection , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the flow bottle should be slowly and carefully sw@@ ung and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete res@@ us@@ per@@ ing of the powder is done .
in the event that any precip@@ itation or dr@@ ink@@ age is visible , the breakthrough flas@@ k must again be gently inver@@ ted in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to the application .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspen@@ sions required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted abrasion is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the owner of the marketing authorization prior to the market launch provides healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing instruction . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a self @-@ circulation of blood is not possible before the intervention , and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to have an own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections may also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as an injection into a vein in a main study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference doctor .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of lung stre@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed have remained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , it was proved that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that completes Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for placing sec@@ ond@@ hand throughout the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the need for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) exists .
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , for planned greater operational procedures that require a large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; this is why the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al stability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance t@@ ins than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance t@@ ins than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and consequences may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; this is why the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al stability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 400 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be kept from 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increases &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reci@@ pro@@ cal cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 400 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
the iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis using the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients undergoing treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ tro@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a second or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic , ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the report should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ addressing ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ mag@@ intoxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the reci@@ pro@@ cal cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be assessed for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits due to epo@@ et@@ ins , if ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased through the concentration required to control an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy ( patients who may need to be trans@@ f@@ used ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a half value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are provided for a larger electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy begins .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting stroke of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lic@@ ated and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrates is identical to the endo@@ genous humane ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ gi@@ tis .

survival and progression progression were examined in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to the controls performed with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ provisions based on intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the owner of the authorisation has to provide healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing instruction . • With clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport through the patients .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Version 3.0 and installed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. is established and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine applied in the traffic is applied .
the owner of the authorisation for the marketing campaign ple@@ dges to carry out the trials and additional measures listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan specified in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP in accordance with each subsequent update of the risk management plan .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management System for medicinal products for human use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • maintaining new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • on demand by the E@@ MEA
• You have suffered a heart attack or a stroke within one month before your treatment • If you suffer from inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or of the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ related increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which re@@ stores itself in further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with se@@ amed before beginning treatment .
very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or block@@ age by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level doesn &apos;t exceed a certain level .
according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ at@@ omas with se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your em@@ itter dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed works as a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances may neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is ahead of you , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines or have been used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain level .
once you are well set , you will receive regular dos@@ ages of between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain level .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the treating physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your physician considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ t off yourself under the skin .

ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can happen - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ots ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your output level is too high .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .

A@@ mel@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ alle ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ mel@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8@@ ,000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was investigated over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently suffered a frac@@ tured frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , a total of 3@@ 57 patients were tested in two trials and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the placebo .
compared to all patients under A@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ ys side effects occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ ran@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ dro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information for physicians to prescri@@ be the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the marketing of A@@ cla@@ sta in the whole of the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ ran@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ ran@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ ran@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) Pati@@ ents with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is present .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data on safety and efficacy is missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ ran@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate prev@@ ent@@ ative dental treatment .
no data is available for patients who need dental treatment if the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which are associated as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured per year before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1,8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a recent frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tist &apos;s area was mainly reported in cancer patients , over oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients were treated with oste@@ on@@ ec@@ dro@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ ort ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years , as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ car@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures reduced by 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta had a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ car@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken out of the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ecular bone volume in comparison with placebo compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ ran@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all points of time .
the treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total , and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ ran@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mostly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared to 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 patients with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ A 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early part phases ( α and β , with the above mentioned half values ) probably represent the rapid resor@@ ption in bone and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the dosage is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances met@@ aboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) among the 64 patients .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and moderate ren@@ al dys@@ functions down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was given in rats , administered at intervals of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the thre@@ ef@@ old human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection point were observed .
the most common occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a fertili@@ zation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such skel@@ etal ab@@ norm@@ alities .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level .
if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is in force and works before and during the product .
risk management plan The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market obli@@ ges the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance that are presented in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known that could affect the current claims on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days , an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) was reached . • On request of E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
when using A@@ ran@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines or have recently been used / used , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using A@@ la@@ sta , together with food and drink , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as A@@ car@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before the completion of the treatment with A@@ BA If you are considering the cess@@ ation of treatment with A@@ ran@@ sta , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after the following in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ ran@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ ran@@ sta .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or deaf feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .
flu , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , ting@@ ling , drow@@ sin@@ ess , trem@@ ors , temporary un@@ consciousness , taste disorder , diar@@ rhe@@ a , inflammation of the stomach , chest pain , hypertension , facial red@@ dening , short@@ ness of breath , skin rash , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst .
persistent pain and / or inc@@ urable wounds in the mouth or the jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects not listed in this information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to take the in@@ fusion of A@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta patients need to be treated with adequate fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic circul@@ ating , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ ran@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ ran@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also included in the EP@@ P ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia has a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or more or more overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for the cess@@ ation of smoking compared to placebo .
however , studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia in this area was difficult to assess .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were detected during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ night avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , t@@ eli@@ or@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight people
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and physicians ) , and for the AR@@ Z
it also contributes to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
margin and depres@@ sive disorders may not be used , unless the benefits of the treatment out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
he also has no apparent risks in patients who - in addition to obesity - can experience depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other close relatives are advised that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown . • It can be applied together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ um or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ n@@ um or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ phon@@ yl alcohol and insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , making type 2 diabetes easier to adjust .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated . in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos lead to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar values were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl agent was 0.@@ 94 % in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional intraven@@ ous placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of insulin and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who had Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin have reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ urred vision disorders , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high levels of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , a de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure should start , the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced Mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the incidence of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output h@@ ep@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other indications of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme parameters are to be monitored as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , cros@@ so@@ vers , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be continued , should be guided by the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ m@@ ite ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ in by 3.1 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as an oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Ques@@ tions per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or she enters it , the treatment should be dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction tas@@ k@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active substances .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was similar to placebo , but less rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ phon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced , advanced mac@@ ular disease the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
there was a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated in treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to function via activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ en@@ ci@@ dal as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to study the time to leave the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ lac@@ cia ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continued to receive insulin but a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison with initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials comparing to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels and slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ icide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one while reduced values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and bili@@ la@@ icide .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the male tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ glaci@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced Mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy .
after oral use , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is resor@@ bed quickly , with the peak concentrations of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the thre@@ ef@@ old of the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies demonstrated that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma eli@@ oration time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the parent substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies included mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat induc@@ es increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ omes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Ques@@ tions per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ icide were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was statisti@@ cally significant in comparison with initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the male tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ glaci@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eride synthesis .
although the study missed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vit@@ alization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summ@@ ari@@ zing analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients receiving comparative treatment , an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women demonstrated .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Ques@@ tions per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ glaci@@ al elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were much lower than any other insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for introducing Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily , if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
every change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin suggest that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
prior to travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grapes , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses may also be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for placing Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
prior to travelling , which are going through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grapes , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that due to intraven@@ ous given Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4,4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) mortality reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is achieved within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ ab@@ etic children ( ages 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

always set up the closing lid of your Nov@@ o@@ Let &apos;s ready @-@ to @-@ use pens if it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Take the injection needle straight and firmly onto Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ gging the large outer flap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • knock down a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect them up in the cartridge - While you keep the injection needle up , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • While the injection needle continues to show up , press the button fully inside ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must be removed from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap on the finished pen again so that the digit stands opposite the met@@ ering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the push button is fully compressed .
if the button is not able to move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outside while you twist the cap • The dial below the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press scale • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backwards , until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel resistance . then take off the cap and put it back on the 0 of the met@@ ering mark .
take care not to press the button while the injection is inj@@ ected . simply press the button after injection until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge - you can use the balance scale to estimate how much insulin is left but you can not use them to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ uria is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or bra@@ id marks ( i.e. larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still sei@@ zur@@ es . therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines for the prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ o@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( placebo drugs ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day during the last three measurements showed a levels of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ ate deposits ( including one from the medical history known or current gou@@ ging and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ g / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people Since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients Since there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , there can be acute g@@ out attacks during the treatment beginning , because the lowering of the serum eye level can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform liver function test before the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and further course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was no interaction studies carried out to F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ory can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine lens ( a blocking of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg twice daily with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ du@@ ms , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be ruled out on side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ment compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase III ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined by these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no heavy rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cholesterol value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .

AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC obtained the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decline in the serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the Phase 3 renewal study showed that the permanent reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gi@@ p@@ pling ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the pla@@ iting no@@ des , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the pla@@ ited no@@ des by month 24 in 54 % of patients .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,5 mc@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses were increased .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline in serum acid concentrations , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant through the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human@@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity arose which was accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid an irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data derived from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
following a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , tri@@ mmed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used for es@@ op@@ hag@@ us disorders , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that may indicate possible sho@@ ot@@ ous reactions , and patients should be advised to remove the medicine in case of symptoms of gl@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe disease @-@ related side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at there was no increased risk , rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men were predominantly administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available to give indications whether the risk of taking a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a cr@@ ative surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at Food and Be@@ verages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate direct damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ oplas@@ mo@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ; most reports stem from cancer patients but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum intake took up &lt; 8.@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.2 mg / dl ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , the average elevation of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo was 8.@@ 8 % in the spine , 5.@@ 9 % in the Fem@@ ale H@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the swelling of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter persi@@ sted ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
there were two plac@@ id @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability declined approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio @-@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies indicate that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or dischar@@ ged with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively tagged substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the F@@ oun@@ ces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function , a somewhat increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

advoc@@ acy is administered to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ@@ s by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , whereas the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the tran@@ spl@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , how often a re @-@ transplan@@ tation or re @-@ intake of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be used .
patients and physicians must be careful if other ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken concur@@ r@@ ently with the law , as the medicine may need to be adjusted accordingly or the dose of the medication taken at the same time .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure is maintained by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
in day 4 systemic exposure , measured as a valley level , was comparable to both ni@@ er- and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under the law to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Advent @-@ tin @-@ scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow for oral in@@ gest@@ ing of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be induced intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dose recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral adv@@ ective therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the tran@@ spl@@ ant .
dose recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of the tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral adv@@ ective therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dose recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a tran@@ spl@@ ant recipient of two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant to adv@@ ent@@ ine once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in the kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must start for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation With adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is daily taken once a day .
other tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , although there is no clinical experience with advoc@@ acy in lung , pancre@@ atic and intestinal transplan@@ ted patients , arrived at a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for color@@ ectal gra@@ ft recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a lowering of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ inc@@ it@@ ance ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the level of seb@@ um in the whole blood The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test controls .
it is recommended frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after adjustment of pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ective , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances which might change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus general blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low level of clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the timing state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the v@@ entri@@ cular levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first period after liver transplan@@ ts are usually within the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and incar@@ n@@ ate - and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; settings of the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has been proven to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are yet available for the retar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients and tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients in childhood are not yet available for clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with advoc@@ acy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a lab@@ ial or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore occur under the law of law .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , over@@ burden and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , sp@@ as@@ ms and bl@@ urred vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ capsules , retar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels in simultaneous administration of substances which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolic rate and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly careful .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
results from a low number of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients have no indication that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 infants , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs can often be found not precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumours was reported in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are supposed to be conveyed by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell nucleus .
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ escent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction pathways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and cardiac transplan@@ ts .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent , mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported that received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , the ob@@ liter@@ ative bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , was less frequent in the first year following the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis were ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection of gra@@ ft was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patient transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the onset of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ative syn@@ dro@@ mes was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized procedure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ dosage ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired levels of blood from 8 to 15 ng / ml in 5 .
intestinal transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ectal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound Group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this makes it possible for tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to be almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor V@@ III ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether or not an Adv@@ ate is used to treat ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or to prevent bleeding during surgery .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor V@@ III deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the drug contains no proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children less than six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding , as well as in surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood cells with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor V@@ III .
advoc@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of lawyers throughout the European Union .
dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the Factor V@@ III deficiency , the place and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in subsequent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor V@@ III activity in the corresponding period should not sink below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the norm or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment process , appropriate determining factor V@@ III plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor V@@ III , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Proph@@ yla@@ xis For long term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A doses of 20 to 40 I.@@ U. of factor V@@ III per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor V@@ III plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor V@@ III therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the speed of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor V@@ III is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always immune to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor V@@ III immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor V@@ III , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor V@@ III product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ dal ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor V@@ III during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor V@@ III ( 5 patients ) who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor V@@ III @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ V@@ III ≤ 2 % ) after exposure to Factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) showed a F@@ V@@ III inhibit@@ or .

the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by the study of antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein ; otherwise , no signs or symptoms occurred which showed an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited issued an official approval to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company re@@ jects its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
it is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , usually contributes to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not function properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient who emerged from Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company in day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
furthermore , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main impact dimensions were the changes in severity of ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose patients who took a@@ ero a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ oric hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , ti@@ redness , som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , or an ill @-@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed on the whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it , cr@@ ushing or ch@@ ew ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been ring@@ ed .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment may be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ po@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva , which are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned Rhin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ ano@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is insufficient to suggest appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to suggest appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be suspended at least 48 hours before the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between those treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential Latvian pathways .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ eal pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , bl@@ urred vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including rein@@ forcing subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the exu@@ ber@@ ant effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
in the context of an individual dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio equivalent was exposure to the gift of an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .
under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous c@@ ann@@ ul@@ ous drug , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer causing a nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( short@@ ness of breath due to a conv@@ ul@@ sion of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you are following the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Cardi@@ ac disease , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headache , or strengthening existing head@@ aches .
if you use aer@@ os@@ ol with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication , even if it is not prescription drugs .
transport efficiency and the use of machines When used in recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ os@@ ol leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you should inform@@ ing immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you should have taken a larger amount of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ os@@ ols If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , throat pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ aches , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rare reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of eye @-@ catching h@@ ep@@ atic values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 ml ly@@ ophi@@ lic acid ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by measuring the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ple , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us reduced by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decline in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
am@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ rel or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms of the symptoms and are resum@@ ed .
in the case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended a continuous treatment during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and Al@@ co@@ hol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic conditions or the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common side effects reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ dose clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered more than ten days a day in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( nine times the clinical dose ) , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including rein@@ forcing subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the total scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain produced by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria leads to an improvement of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patient demo@@ graphy with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant infection after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not respond to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n with a comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n reveal no particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience increased compound exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which is highly met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily di@@ oram@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied for over 14 days a day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents was not an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in clinical trials for not interfer@@ ing with psych@@ om@@ otor behavior .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing of alcohol was neither to increase the alcohol induced deterioration nor to an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the total scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the induced rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations for children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which can be metabol@@ ised .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ ling bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene inter@@ closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets during the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ dose clinical dose ) were applied .
in two single dose trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

there is limited experience in clinical trials for the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets in the treatment of children under the age of 6 have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for the loss formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including the ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet containing A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophi@@ lic acid , the form@@ ulations were bi@@ ologically equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose trials in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 years , which can be metabol@@ ised , is identical to that of children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants , between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events were reported more often than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was observed to avoid side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents was not an increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may vary depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ ting tablet is individually packed in bli@@ ster packs with 5 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 60 , 90 and 100 cans of the enam@@ el tablet .
when taking A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet together with food and drink , A@@ eri@@ us mel@@ ange does not need to be taken with water or any other liquid .
if you forgot about taking A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s enam@@ el tablet if you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan .
after the launch of A@@ eri@@ us very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves ) and rash .
A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking up is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution for inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for preparations is included with sc@@ aling , you can use this alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rhe@@ a , fever and in@@ som@@ nia were common side effects during adults when fatigue , dry mouth and headache were reported more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or an application sp@@ lash of F@@ û@@ r preparations for inser@@ tion with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially informed of the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus arises , which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognis@@ es the human body as a body @-@ foreign ) , was cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
in doing so , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Gui@@ delines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical examination and need more information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , as@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs have taken the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r daily and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , as@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
AIDS cannot heal but can delay the immune system &apos;s damage and thus also dela@@ ying the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , with low dose ri@@ k@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under as@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks as in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
as@@ gener@@ ase may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s Wort ( herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are just as degra@@ ded as as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking as@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of a li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune function syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
as@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resist@@ ence pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso @-@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gen@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information of these medicines .
patients with existing limited liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ idal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ an symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other illnesses associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. Higher ages , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strates the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso @-@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate for the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already adop@@ ts St. John &apos;s wort , the anti @-@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ ene levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg were applied twice daily to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % decreased when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with calcium ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study to use A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the proceeds from di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is reduced .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies of azi@@ gen@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole at 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may also lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase since it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a lowering of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ ol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these pharmaceuticals .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ b@@ ance and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ dence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous offering of am@@ re@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels should be expected at simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended for more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is present ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied together with an or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with par@@ enter@@ al care .
data on simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 @-@ dro@@ pl@@ ets .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ an symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation of how the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is simultaneously administered with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , and alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the in@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during lac@@ tation during lac@@ tation .
the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the adverse events listed below come from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ating and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fat sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated with 2@@ 45 NR@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canc@@ eled with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI advanced patients receiving 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose ri@@ k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low doses ri@@ k@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is advised to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral ga@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ polar poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ o@@ des with the result of an un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logy failure was up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed a resistance pattern similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for assessing the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r generates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ence paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously untreated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them indicated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of twenty isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and zo@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may affect subsequent treatment .
the receipt of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logy ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI@@ s ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI , and at least one NR@@ TI@@ s were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ macy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the plasma at the time @-@ ad@@ jus@@ tic@@ ated average change ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ su@@ ici@@ dal wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bound A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentrations &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increase for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous consumption of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment scheme leads to am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those used on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous dosing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in male animals occurred in do@@ ings which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations were included in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , either during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development .
24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug dependent factors , such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ night avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is reduced .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ ol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these pharmaceuticals .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ dence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the in@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation during lac@@ tation .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is advised to observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , pharmaceuticals that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation methods are still not fully mature in juven@@ iles , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
as@@ gener@@ ase solution to take @-@ in is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not covered by either PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dose ri@@ k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination is avoided in these patient populations .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ enor@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking small children and children under 4 years of age , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 from transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determination of drug concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in H@@ amm@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ b@@ ance and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are significantly higher after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tic rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the in@@ ni@@ cation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation during lac@@ tation .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that may have detri@@ mental effects on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is carried out three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks of break between treatment cycles .
the cream is dil@@ ly applied to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo delivered either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with placebo .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ak@@ in@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions restrict the efficacy and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream continues until all visible war@@ ts are gone in the genital or perio@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection occurs in the treatment area .
if the les@@ ions were completely cured during the follow up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should take the cream once he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied areas infected with inclin@@ ation infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily in@@ compati@@ bilities were performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision were observed .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment has also been observed in rare cases .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which required emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for treatment of external war@@ ts in the genital and perio@@ anal area , no clinical experience has been carried out so far .
limited data indicates an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reduction in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the elimination of the war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have any clinical experience , so the use in previously untreated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine was not studied for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis at anatom@@ ical locations outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take off in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 patients had a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although there are no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) after a unique topical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ c patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ Creme from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial phase III were shown below .
the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related to adverse effects , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ Creme treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream often occurred to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / leaf / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream , severe ery@@ them@@ ums ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe severity and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical studies for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were demonstrated following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy with regard to complete healing of the inclin@@ ations in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
60 % of all patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine were totally exhausted ; this was in 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ day use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had been clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two weeks of treatment , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyp@@ er @-@ kerat@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acc@@ esses within a related 25 c@@ m2 of treatment area on the un@@ easy scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ in@@ osis and hyper@@ sensitive bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic image of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure shown that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine to topical application on MC @-@ affected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mit@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months also showed no similar effects in mice .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is unknown , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
tum@@ ors oc@@ cured in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
furthermore , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) .
most of the time they are lighter skin reactions , which end up again within about 2 weeks of the treatment .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin damage , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application site ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ten@@ derness , swelling , s@@ wollen and scar@@ ring ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , con@@ ges@@ tion , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , redness , swelling , sor@@ es , lim@@ b pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neurological symptoms of the M@@ PS I may appear : increased liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with rein@@ vigor@@ ating devices , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may react to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and , if necessary , update this summary .
the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will see patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ oth cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion date ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting , in which res@@ sources for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase III study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to be found within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related response must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or antibodies ) , to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be induced and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to breast milk over mother &apos;s milk is present , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
side effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , which were observed during phase 3 study and their renewal in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over for a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe vascular shape and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients there was a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ release within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereas in patients at the age of 5 with a severe kidney failure ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , no antibodies det@@ ectable by radio immun@@ op@@ lec@@ tomy ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say were present , among them 3 patients with whom there was never a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with a lack of up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies didn &apos;t seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the therapy of enzymes depend on the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were evaluated in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to be treated in the following table .
an open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decline in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into consideration by using a combined end@@ point ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , overall improvement was observed in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with the severe kidney shape and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ us levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a growth of size ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy flow form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up showed a normal mental develop@@ mental velocity , whereas in the older patients with severe vascular shape were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ al met@@ ering schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dos@@ ages is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .

within the given time , the owner of the authorisation for placing on the market has completed the following program of study , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , is present either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase has occurred with you .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you are using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take pharmaceuticals containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
the concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians and medical personnel ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , can gradually be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - unconditional participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( incidence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ aches • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Ref@@ rain • fever • Flu@@ id fever • Incre@@ ased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient , first determine the number of bottles that can be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
in patients who have not previously been treated , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therefore s@@ lows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease who had previously been treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug for cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival compared to the comparative investig@@ ational medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the incor@@ poration of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
every pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for the predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for the predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third action cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood image should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the an@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
following the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped when in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 or so@@ - continues in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 or above , compared to 65 years of age , there is an increased risk of adverse effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require any dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function in@@ hibition of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( for presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils return to a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ fet@@ al toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ etic lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a treatment with a fixed fixed fixed method , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with fixed @-@ fixed fixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer should be weighed before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this drug was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible bit@@ ing of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised of the treatment - G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised when high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy , be avoided on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - tens 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b must be avoided , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy calls for increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use in pregnant women , but as with older an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy .
pen@@ di@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy unless it is mandatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm relationship .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed exceeds mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ feeding infant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , and in 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects of frequency data : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasional ) of the patients random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the phase 2 mixed @-@ mixed mono therapy studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ in@@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSCLC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who were random@@ ised to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
clinical trials were occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fusion , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis , and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
clinical trials sometimes reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in fixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy regi@@ mens ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by disrup@@ ting sandwich and acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ roid syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ amine dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ tin cle@@ oti@@ des .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and the worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC was medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.@@ 0 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel is similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ macy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.2 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = Contin@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ macy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ suffici@@ ency threshold of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.@@ 1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats to be fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stools , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily bow@@ el , ab@@ rupt secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ dal , fat @-@ reduced diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ asis • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or high @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before beginning a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as pharmaceuticals for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
additional pregnancy prevention measures are recommended to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with concur@@ rent use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international standard ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained normal .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of unwanted side effects found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , rapid feedback of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect works in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ i and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical trials suggest that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ isch , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosage of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of a cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients who showed approximately 42 % of the overall plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is applied and works before and during the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the activity of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the start of the treatment , since at that time you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in already a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial Nach@@ tisch@@ sch@@ ist , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not apply all@@ i after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ agel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of al@@ im@@ xi can be increased by the additional application of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined for 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are powerful or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate stimul@@ ator for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : in order to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting due to a cancer illness .
the effectiveness of al@@ im@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon inflammation , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection should be closely monitored .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic applications , in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ o@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing testim@@ oni@@ als .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been performed because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an over@@ dose of Alo@@ xi@@ an .
in two random@@ ized double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ous day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously day 1 .
results from studies with moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ formation and rep@@ lication and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a gradual elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ally half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous injection of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron measured on 3 consecutive days , total current position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after a one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , are involved in the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection in healthy subjects , total body temperature was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but this does not justify a reduction in the dose .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after exposure to exposure , which is considered sufficient above the maximum human exposure , indicating low relevance for clinical use .
10 Thanks to prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications pointed out that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ formation and rep@@ lication and can pro@@ long the period of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given over two years daily , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since al@@ xi is determined by humans to one unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .

June 2006 The Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicine &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( prolonged ) hepatitis C ( hepatitis C caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue shows damage , furthermore , the values of the enzyme alpha amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are norm@@ alized in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it in the formation of the active substance .
the Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturer presented data that att@@ est to the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after receiving the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood reported ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only provided by the CH@@ MP .
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was retar@@ ded in more patients than with the reference doctor ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection resulting with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
alt@@ ar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ seed resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect this type of infection .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , it is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect of Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the place of the order .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks associated with the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ in@@ sk@@ ed skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ul@@ in is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral in@@ gest@@ ation and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fo@@ etal / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to admini@@ ster systemic antibiotics .
if the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefits of breast@@ feeding should be weighed for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation at the administration which concerned about 1 % of patients .
impact Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mut@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50 &apos;s bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances from binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partially P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts .
no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ il Sal@@ be was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adults before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic image taken by humans after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .

Ambi@@ ani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ ani is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , where protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ isation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be concluded from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is requested for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines function by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the recently approved twin @-@ rix vaccine , and the recently approved &quot; Twin@@ rix &quot; vaccine that has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix grow@@ n@@ ups contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix grow@@ n@@ ups were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month period and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ ani took between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ ani may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
when a fever vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a fres@@ her up as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation pattern with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units with a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody , so that in these cases the gift of other vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome in the glut@@ eal muscle , these injection methods should be avoided .
however , in case of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ ani can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously because in these cases it can come to bleeding after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ability , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were given to Ambi@@ rix in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and wear@@ iness on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ oun Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after Ambi@@ rix &apos;s administration at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects given Ambi@@ rix were suffering from pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who were given Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of the form @-@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different statisti@@ cally .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years of age , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 received two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three cans .
among the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for individuals aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be shown 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year coinci@@ des with the discovery of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ um , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis type b vaccine , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine may be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ se on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via fer@@ mented foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other channels , such as bathing in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses ( although you / your child feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin rather than into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your own body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ ani can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you have received / received other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have received / or your child been vacc@@ inated recently , or if you have received / or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be ino@@ cul@@ ated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix does not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ ani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was put into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the lead tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose to the stomach of the leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active agent ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , an abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste dysfunction , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information on this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with a delay @-@ resistant form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if there is hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bab@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency syndrome have to receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate are administered via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ ry top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
extern@@ ally seen , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ glut@@ amine .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues in the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
survival rate was 98 % in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ Tran@@ scar@@ bab@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after taking .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma next morning following different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma stamp on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine .
following the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no indic@@ ative effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children unable to swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bab@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , respectively 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions occurred in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ ry top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
extern@@ ally seen , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
based on tests on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ al@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle , we can assume that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ meth@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in treatment , and a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after taking .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if your laboratory studies are conducted , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , aband@@ on@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , feel free to contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS out of the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose to the stomach ) .
31 • Take a wooden tabl@@ es@@ po@@ on of gran@@ ul@@ at from the container . • Send a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equal to one measuring spoon . • Take the recommended amount of tabl@@ es@@ po@@ ons gran@@ ulate out of the tank .
angi@@ ogen@@ esis is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; static up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measuring value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ogram is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ogram in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ogram - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ogram was just as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ogram may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ira , other Hi@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ot@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous 0.@@ 25 mg / kg intraven@@ ous dose followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical need .
immediately prior to the procedure , a cle@@ av@@ age of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us indication of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt of Bol@@ us was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the dose dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ valent against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of Bol@@ us@@ dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT score was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ val@@ ry bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ogram is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active agent or any other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or increased blood pressure due to a mal@@ function of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
although most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally occur throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine , monitoring of the IN@@ R value should be considered in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine reaches the existing level once again .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ents with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental studies are insufficient in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira , plus GP@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ry @-@ group and in the treated groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings performed significantly less often than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ ine plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge of ≥ 5 cm in the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed , bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information about side effects are based on the data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine Group and in the treated groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
Angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ry , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in the cl@@ ots .
the Bin@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ira to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , for its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ry with serum from patients in which the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ din shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ cular anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the following case , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or by PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or upper arm or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin pens .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or administered sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc dela@@ ying , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of symp@@ athetic nervous system such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ thi@@ din and reserves .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral treatment .
listed below are listed by clinical studies known to adverse drug us@@ ages , grouped by system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , may result in a lip@@ se d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by an appropriately trained person , or intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous glucose by a physician .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin also lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose consumption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) , as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional , glucose @-@ giving effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ oid .
it was obvious from the data that a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was achieved in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , better post @-@ pran@@ ic control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human regular insulin , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal begins ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human regular insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
