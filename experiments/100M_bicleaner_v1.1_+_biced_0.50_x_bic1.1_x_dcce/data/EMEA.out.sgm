<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report (EPAR) in which the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also included in the EPP) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Cwirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things which are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal upsetting) alternate with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes associated with the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbance if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are at the same time taking other medicines which are removed just as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibozol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripibozol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser degree the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripivotzol contributes to normalize the brain activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness using the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to absorb (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased restlessness than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies to treat bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks, and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased restlessness compared to placebo, and were similar to lordosis.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal dysfunctions (drowsiness), tremor (drowsiness), sedation (drowsiness), nausea, vomiting, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in patients who mainly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disturbance, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company "Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd." a permit for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and their manic episodes were related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With respect to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aria prazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide associated with Aripibozol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, transmission problems), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, have to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aripivotzol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripibozol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiqzol had increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in treated with Aripivotzol patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events involving patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polyphenes, polyphenols, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combo-dities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripibozol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiqzol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiqzol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose levels prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify may be accounted for with a moderate increase in Aripibolic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">Doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the mediums of CYP2D6 (dextroomorphan / 3 method xymorphinan ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextroomorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy while treating with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Because of the insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripibozol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiqzol showed a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripibozol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiqzol, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiboxylic treatment and 53.3% in patients with cervical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients under Aripibozol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiboxylic treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters occured, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphatase), in general temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivotzol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiqzol, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older Dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosage with Aripibozol alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiqzol has a high plasma antibody.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptor and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripivotzol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to the serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">Intravenous emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the Nucleus caudatus and the putts.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripivotzol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operation-controlled trial in week 52 the share of the respondent patients, who had a response to the study media, was similar in both groups (Aripivotzol 77% and Halfdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messages defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Halfdol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripivotzol showed a significantly higher rate of recurrence rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, less patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripivotzol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripibozol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, Aripivotzol showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-surgery in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripibozol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium and semi-surgery.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripivotzol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripibozol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripibozol was superior to the prevention of bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripibozol, the N-dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination rate is approximately 75 hours for Aripibozol for extensive metabolisiers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to the ethnic origin or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiqzol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impact of liver function on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the potential carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the middle stealing state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of Aripiprazole sulfate conjugates of Aripibozol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (ranging from 1 to 3fold to mean dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in human limbs at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripibozol no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed in rabbits following dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times of the medium steady state AUC at the recommended maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="147">If an oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify's enamel tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiqzol injection solution in patients with aggitis and behavioural disorders caused differently from schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiqzol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure abnormalities (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiqzol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (either prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, transmission problems), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mn are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polyphenes, polyphenols, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after a certain application of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers applied Aripiprazole (15 mg dosage) as one-off charge intramuscular and who received lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolites can result in the common application of CYP2D6 with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibozol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and that is why similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose levels prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) received intramuscularly, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after some gift from Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiqzol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more frequent (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiboxylic treatment was 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiboxylic treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripibozol treatment was 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters occured, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripivotzol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiqzol, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances were the Aripivotzol injection solution with statistically significant greater enhancements of aggiciousness / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripivotzol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of aggitiousness and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggitiousness, a similar effectiveness was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripivotzol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operation-controlled trial in week 52 the share of the respondent patients, who had a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (aria prazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%.</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from Messages defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Halfdol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripibozol (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripibozol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, less patients achieved an increase of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripivotzol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripibozol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripibozol was superior to the prevention of bipolar regression, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripimagnizol AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after injection of intramuscular injection; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiqzol injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), the 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application showed no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional trials with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans; this means that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10-times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of Aripibozol hydroxylic metabolites in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times of the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose or 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was examined in a main study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer took part, of which about three quarters were previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients with Abraxane were able to respond to the treatment compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators showed that Abraxanes was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low or low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel medicines there is no need to be given to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the marketing of Abraxane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-based therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="286">If there are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the administration of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipation methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used for pregnant women or women of childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, unless the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with abraxane will be advised to leave no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a spermacervation prior to the treatment, as the treatment with abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (common), which can affect transport efficiency and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events occurring in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxanes as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stool, esophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, headaches, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness, Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Antimised rotubules, which promotes the coagulation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transensing-dothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumreceptor and, due to the albumin protein SPARC (cream protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation appears in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unanimous untreated trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used for over 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% for metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First-Line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to finish on Baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxanes with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active substance exposition (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After receiving an intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">Mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high volume of distribution points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or partial binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent containing paclitaxel and also the distribution volume was higher in abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the average for cumulative urine leakage was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic agent and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be taken care of when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile injection, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into an abraxane flow bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the flow bottle should be slowly and carefully swung and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete resuspering of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">In the event that any precipitation or drinkage is visible, the breakthrough flask must again be gently inverted in order to achieve a complete resuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values, in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a self-circulation of blood is not possible before the intervention, and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to have an own blood circulation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections may also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which enables them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as an injection into a vein in a main study of 479 patients who suffered from anaemia caused by kidney problems, compared to the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of lung streamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to seamed have remained in the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, it was proved that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that completes Abseamed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for placing secondhand throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the need for transfusion in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy) exists.</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, for planned greater operational procedures that require a large blood volume replacement (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; this is why the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobal stability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l), epoetin alfa is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance tins than patients where initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance tins than patients where initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and consequences may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; this is why the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobal stability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number by ≥ 400 cells / µl compared to the baseline, the dose should be kept from 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increases &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reciprocal cyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte count increased by ≥ 400 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reciprocal cyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should receive seamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis using the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients undergoing treatment with any erythropoetin in an erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Atrosia, PRCA) should not receive a second or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic, venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger electro-orthopedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as a reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the report should be determined and the usual causes for a non-addressing (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminimagintoxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reciprocal cyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be assessed for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the level of haemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits due to epoetins, if haemoglobin concentration is increased through the concentration required to control anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the level of haemoglobin should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa drugs and erythropoetin response should be taken into account in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy (patients who may need to be transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a half value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anaemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the use of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are provided for a larger electro-orthopedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before epoetin alfa therapy begins.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with a starting stroke of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7,5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in regard to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically derived epoetin alfa is glycosilicated and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrates is identical to the endogenous humane erythropoetin that was isolated from the urine of anaesthetic patients.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The package insert • contraindication in pregnancy and for breastfeeding women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to take back medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg intravenous infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic hip fracture, administration of the infusion of Aransta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aransta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aransta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see Section 4.4) Patients with a creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min are not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is present.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary, as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, because data on safety and efficacy is missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (creatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the fusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient supply of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aransta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventative dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental treatment if the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients receiving Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 from 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunctions, which are associated as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in the serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured per year before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced renal function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1,8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l), were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures following a recent fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial, local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the orthodontist's area was mainly reported in cancer patients, over osteonekrosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients were treated with osteonecdrosis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of an overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD-T-score for the Schenkelhort ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years, as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Acarsta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a reduced risk of spinal fractures reduced by 60% compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Acarsta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increasing the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the thigh neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies, bone biopsies were taken out of the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume in comparison with placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were measured in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aransta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all points of time.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% in total, and 4.3% at the Schenkelhals.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (Study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly gift of Alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebra after 24 months compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aransta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mostly light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.6fold to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value when inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronate in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Alasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as respondents at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Compared to 71 patients treated with risedronate compared to 71 of patients treated with risedronate, the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients with Risedronat could be maintained during an average follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level decreased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ A 0,24 and t ½ -1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early part phases (α and β, with the above mentioned half values) probably represent the rapid resorption in bone and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the dosage is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochrome-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) among the 64 patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and moderate renal dysfunctions down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">For severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was given in rats, administered at intervals of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the threefold human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection point were observed.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysise of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a fertilization that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such skeletal abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the drug is not immediately used, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonate, and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, ensuring a normal bone formation, giving strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Reporting Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown. • It can be applied together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyharnum or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyharnum or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulphonyl alcohol and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, making type 2 diabetes easier to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was investigated. in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonyl resin, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar values were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional application of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl agent was 0.94% in HbA1c values, while the additional intravenous placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of insulin and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who had Actos in addition to insulin have reported a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were blurred vision disorders, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, vaulted and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), a decompensated congestive heart failure should start, the physician should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and oedema when used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced Macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the incidence of congestive heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output hepatic values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other indications of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3-times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme parameters are to be monitored as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, crossovers, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be continued, should be guided by the laboratory parameters from clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrimite (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocriin by 3.1% and hematocriins by 1-2% and hematocriin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as an oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazoldindions, including pioglitazone, was reported about a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological clarification should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Questions per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or she enters it, the treatment should be deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reduction taskase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from pioglitazone by 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease in AUC from pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not available from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege was similar to placebo, but less rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced, advanced macular disease the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency in pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about cardiac insufficiency in pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients treated in treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function via activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Glicencidal as monotherapy was continued over two years to study the time to leave the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaccia).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to patients who continued to receive insulin but a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotient was statistically significant in comparison with initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials comparing to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels and slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced overall plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclaicide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone while reduced values were observed under metformin and bililaicide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the male triglycerides, but also improved the postglacial elevated triglyceride levels, both with an effect on the triglyceride level and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced Macrovascular disease were randomised in groups that received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use, pioglitazone is resorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the threefold of the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies demonstrated that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or rifampicin (a P450 2C8-inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elioration time of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearances of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies included mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in the gestation decreases and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat induces increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazoldindions led to increased frequency of colonosomes.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Questions per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each Pioglitazone or Gliclaicide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotient was statistically significant in comparison with initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the male triglycerides, but also improved the postglacial elevated triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic trygliceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the objective of its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery disease, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary vascularization and revitalization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to use the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that blood sugar levels were much lower than any other insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package insert).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane were outweigh the risks associated with diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for introducing Actraphane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily, if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Every change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin analog or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin suggest that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Prior to travelling, which are going through several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform liver function test before the start of the Febuxostattreatment and further course depending on clinical findings (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas no interaction studies carried out to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibitory can lead to an increase in theophylline lens (a blocking of the metabolisation of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated 250 mg twice daily with an increase in Febuxostature (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an average 22% increase in AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antazidums, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAX by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 renewal study showed that the permanent reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gippling).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the plaiting nodes, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the plaited nodes by month 24 in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5,5 mcIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses were increased.</seg>

<seg id="1322">There were two placid-controlled trials in which Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg. a day either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of Alendronat reduced the incidence of at least one new vertebrate fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% compared to placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption In an intravenous reference dose, the average oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fast and two hours before starting a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability declined approximately 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) did not lead to any clinically meaningful change in the oral bio-availability of Alendronat (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies indicate that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or discharged with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After the intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate about 50% of the radioactively tagged substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the Founces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronat is not excreted by the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it influences the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Elimination In the absence of radioactively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers, the mean excretion of radioactivity in urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in the fur after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not deposited in the bone, is quickly excreted via urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is nevertheless expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal testing will also be reduced in patients with reduced renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, in patients with reduced renal function, a somewhat increased accumulation of alendronate in bone is expected (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1416">In day 4 systemic exposure, measured as a valley level, was comparable to both nier- and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus test levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under the law to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, an adjustment of the Advent-tin-scheme can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dose recommendation - changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant recipient of two daily doses of Prograf capsules on a daily intake of Advagraf, so this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressant to adventine once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in the kidney and liver transplant must start for the prophylaxis of the graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation With adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is daily taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advocacy in lung, pancreatic and intestinal transplanted patients, arrived at a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for colorectal graft recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a lowering of the dose in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatinincitance ance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the level of sebum in the whole blood The dosage should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus test controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of tacrolimus blood levels during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood sebaceous levels of tacrolimus should also be checked after adjustment of prograf to advective, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent use of substances which might change the tacrolimus general blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low level of clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the timing state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the ventricular levels of tacrolimus in full blood in the first period after liver transplants are usually within the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and incarnate - and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; settings of the formulation or regime should only be carried out in close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which has been proven to be therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data are yet available for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood are not yet available for clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with advocacy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a labial or septum-hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was to be observed, which can therefore occur under the law of law.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infection, overburden and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels in simultaneous administration of substances which can change the CYP3A metabolic rate and adjust the tacrolimus dose accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thereby increase hormonal exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus can potentially decrease the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Results from a low number of transplant patients have no indication that in tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumours was reported in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are supposed to be conveyed by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to calciumescent inhibiting of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus oppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patient transplanted patients, in 475 patients who underwent pancreatic transplantation and were used in 630 cases following an intestinal transplantation as the primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the large studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and cardiac transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported that received either tacrolimus or ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplant rejection, the obliterative bronchiolitis, was less frequent in the first year following the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases of the development of a bronchiolitis were obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection of graft was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patient transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the onset of a bronchiolitis of obliterative syndromes was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and renal transplantation following a randomized procedure of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral Initialdosage (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired levels of blood from 8 to 15 ng / ml in 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as the primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the unbound Group of tacrolimus, or by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This makes it possible for tacrolimus to be almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly done through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether or not an Advate is used to treat haemorrhage or to prevent bleeding during surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method known as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the drug contains no proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children less than six years, the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding, as well as in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of Advate in prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood cells with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted the company Baxter AG a permit for the marketing of lawyers throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy are based on the severity of the Factor VIII deficiency, the place and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In subsequent hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not sink below the specified plasma levels (in% of the norm or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, appropriate determining factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses of 20 to 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always immune to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII immunoglobuline, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously untreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestic well-known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-tidal) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women, there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors of Factor VIII (5 patients) who showed a higher risk of inhibitors formation, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels was performed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the VIII- Spiegel in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) showed a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated patients treated with ADVATE inhibitors VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by the study of antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein; otherwise, no signs or symptoms occurred which showed an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited issued an official approval to the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company rejects its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene, which is not defective in the human body, usually contributes to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not function properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient who emerged from Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company in day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Furthermore, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerosaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerosaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impact dimensions were the changes in severity of hayfever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose patients who took aero aze reported a 46.0% decrease in symptoms compared to 35.9% in the patients pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, tiredness, somnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active agents or loratadin (another drug used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), or an ill-hagic stroke (stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the marketing of Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed on the whole (i.e. without tearing it, crushing or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have been ringed.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment may be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, dihydropoergotamine or other deconjunctiva, which are peroral or nasal as abovementioned Rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nanoolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data is insufficient to suggest appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerosaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to suggest appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be suspended at least 48 hours before the performance of dermatological tests, since antihistamines may otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerobaze during pregnancy is not assured, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases there may be a dizziness that can lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with potential Latvian pathways.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordieal pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance, including reinforcing subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo was noted at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a pseudoephedrine monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the exuberant effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of an individual dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow-balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of Desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of Pseudoephedrine bio equivalent was exposure to the gift of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin, however, does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are following the following symptoms or illnesses under the application of aerosaze: • High blood pressure • Cardiac disease, palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headache, or strengthening existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you use aerosol with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Transport efficiency and the use of machines When used in recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerosol leads to drowsiness or reduces attention.</seg>

<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten the intake of aerosols If you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects affect you significantly or you may notice any side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chase, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, throat pain, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headaches, sleep disorders, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadin it was very rare reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of eye-catching hepatic values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 ml lyophilic acid (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by measuring the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruple, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius reduced by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urtikaria, the decline in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Amerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, laurel or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical trials for the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (symptoms of less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms of the symptoms and are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the case of persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended a continuous treatment during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and Alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drowsiness, which can lead to impairment of traffic conditions or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius in the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common side effects reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study that was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-dose clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical trial with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered more than ten days a day in a dose of 45 mg. a day (nine times the clinical dose), no extension of the Qtc interval indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance, including reinforcing subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the total scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain produced by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, notwithstanding the etiology of different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causative factor in all arial diseases, it is expected that, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of urticaria leads to an improvement of the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronically idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrilaterals at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadin in comparison to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study comparing patient demography with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant infection after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not respond to the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin with a comparable degree of exposure to desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin reveal no particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that there is no data available to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years metabolise Desloratadin and experience increased compound exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children aged between 2 and 11 years, which is highly metabolized, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study of adults and adolescents, with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years, who were eligible for an antihistamine therapy, received a daily dioramatadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was applied for over 14 days a day, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study on adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-times clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day for adults and adolescents was not an increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets performed in clinical trials for not interfering with psychomotor behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous ingesting of alcohol was neither to increase the alcohol induced deterioration nor to an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the basis of the total scores of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the induced rhinitis caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronically idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrilaterals at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this constrained metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formulations for children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which can be metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active ingredient accumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the AUC- and CMAx values of desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. was officially informed of the Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company takes its application for approval of Aflunov to prevent aviar H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus arises, which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognises the human body as a body-foreign), was cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">In doing so, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine did not suffice to meet the requirements of the EMEA Guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical examination and need more information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenerase is available as a solution to take, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs have taken the patient before, and the likelihood of the virus to be addressed to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg knight avir daily and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral drugs, asgenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot heal but can delay the immune system's damage and thus also delaying the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, with low dose rikavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under asgenerase, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the treatment with Ritonavir strengthened the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger trash of the viral load after four weeks as in patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asgenerase may also not be used in patients who use St. John's Wort (herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals that are just as degraded as asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who are taking asgenerase have the risk of a lipoystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a osteonekrose (death of bone tissue) or an immune function syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken any protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of asgenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Asgenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistence pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than from Amprenavir as capsule; hence, asgenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg knight avir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase must not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrome P450-iso-enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asgenase, does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous anti-viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing limited liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased incidence of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of asterase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determination of drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opian symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenerase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. Higher ages, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as lasting antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In Hammophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors reports of an increase in haemorrhage including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorothrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), osteonekrose cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also substrates the cytochrome P450-iso-enzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolised via CYP2D6 and associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC from Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate for the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, undesirable effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already adopts St. John's wort, the anti-prenavirene levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increased for CMAX by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg were applied twice daily to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreased when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with calcium (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg knight avir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination are not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study to use Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antazian component of didanosine it is recommended that the proceeds from didanosin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amenoravir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised because delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be made, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies of azigenase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole at 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors by CYP3A4, may also lead to interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Therefore, patients should be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenerase since it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous application of anticonvulsants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a lowering of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Noldipin and Verapamil may be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensify associated side effects including hypotension, visual disturbance and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% -Confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous offering of amrease with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels should be expected at simultaneous administration of asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while Amprenavir is present (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be applied together with an orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using parenteral Midazolam with parenteral care.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of midazolam by 3 to 4-droplets.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opian symptoms, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation of how the Amprenavir dose can be adjusted if Amprenavir is simultaneously administered with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, and alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous use of asgenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactic rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known if Amprenavir is transferred to humans into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the innication in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during lactation during lactation.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness was studied in controlled clinical trials in adults and children aged 4 and over in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase Treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to the intake of asgenerase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events listed below come from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients treated with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study mediating and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fat subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pretreated persons treated with amenoravir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated with 245 NRTI- treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs for a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapal nature, with or without itching and spontaneously appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canceled with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI advanced patients receiving 600 mg Agenerase twice daily with low dose rikonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed very frequently in patients who received asgenerase along with low doses rikonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is advised to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gaag- and gag-polar polyproteinodes with the result of an unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not previously treated patients with currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir bleached treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not previously treated patients who received 700mg Fosamenoravir with 100mg knight avir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virology failure was up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children in which a virologistic failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with protease inhibitors showed a resistance pattern similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virology failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I62V, V82A / C / V, I62V, V82A / C / V, I62V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance testing based analyses of clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data for assessing the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples with reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir generates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistence paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not previously untreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir (one of them indicated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 insulates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of twenty isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and zoquinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Amprenavir reserves its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults after virology (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTIs) or standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least one other PI, and at least one NRTIs were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the plasma at the time-adjusticated average change (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-suicidal wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbound Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase solution for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentrations &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "untreated" "" "asgenerase should be taken into account in therapy optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the medium duration (tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increase for CMAX by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous consumption of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound Amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, asgenerase solution and asgenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>

<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations were included in human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, either during the administration of asgenerase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus jugation and minor skeletal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If asgenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of Amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipin, Nifedipin, Nimodipine, Noldipin and Verapamil may be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol dropped by about 86% (90% -Confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2208">Because of the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimine cream should be applied with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although there are no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) after a unique topical application, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects in trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of the treatment of the warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalic patients treated with Imiquimine-Creme from a placebo-controlled clinical trial phase III were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related to adverse effects, were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimine-Creme treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three-times weekly treatment with Imiquimine-cream often occurred to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / leaf / shed (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimine-cream, severe erythemums (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe severity and calcification (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies for the application of Imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg imiquimine, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotension normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were demonstrated following the topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 phase-relevant phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy with regard to complete healing of the inclinations in an Imiquimine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of all patients who had been treated with Imiquimine were totally exhausted; this was in 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 with Imiquimiodine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Efficacy of Imiquimiodine in five-day use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfictional basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients had been clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine in one or two weeks of treatment in one or two weeks of treatment, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyper-keratotic, non-hypertrophic accesses within a related 25 cm2 of treatment area on the uneasy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications of external warts, actinic keratinosis and hypersensitive basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic image of the 5% Imiquimine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure shown that the resorption of Imiquimine to topical application on MC-affected skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superfictional basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mitz weight; a study carried out for four months also showed no similar effects in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice in three days a week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is unknown, but since Imiquimine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors occured in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Muolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of the MPS I may appear: increased liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with reinvigorating devices, and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal big liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduracyme may react to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction), not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyme will see patients who receive Aldurazyme with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the placing of Aldurazyme across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammoth cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mucopolaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion date (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting, in which ressources for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase III study, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase are expected to be found within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related response must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment has to be cautiously avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion with drugs (antihistaminika and / or antibodies), to minimize the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of mild or moderate infusion, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be induced and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular image of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns exposed to breast milk over mother's milk is present, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to alduracyms, which were observed during phase 3 study and their renewal in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over for a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe vascular shape and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients there was a serokonrelease within 3 months after the start of the treatment, whereas in patients at the age of 5 with a severe kidney failure (average after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature ejection from the study), no antibodies detectable by radio immunoplectomy (RIP) Assay were present, among them 3 patients with whom there was never a serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies didn't seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the therapy of enzymes depend on the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decline in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the GAG-Spiegel was observed in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into consideration by using a combined endpoint (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), overall improvement was observed in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with the severe kidney shape and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg for the last 26 weeks due to increased Gagus levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth of size (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the heavy flow form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up showed a normal mental developmental velocity, whereas in the older patients with severe vascular shape were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldural metering schemata were carried out on the GAG-Spiegel in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosages is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate every new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to those affected by elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity with a unique dose, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, a "antiemetic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed therefore slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Alimta was examined for the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease who had previously been treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared to gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival compared to the comparative investigational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the incorporation of Alimta across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin to first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma except for the predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for the predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid will be given the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week prior to the first pemetremixed dose as well as after each third action cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed, a complete blood image should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into consideration the anadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Following the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped when in patients after 2 doses of dose a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 or so- continues in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 or above, compared to 65 years of age, there is an increased risk of adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require any dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function inhibition of &gt; the 1.5-times upper bilirubin limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (for presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with immunosuppression and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils return to a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-fetal toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with Pemetrexed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophetic lactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) have to avoid simultaneous ingesting nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the treatment with pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a treatment with a fixed fixed fixed method, must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with fixed-fixed fixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the ergometer should be weighed before the pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving pemetremixed when this drug was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible biting of reproductive capacity by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised of the treatment - Ginn to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to reduced pemetremixed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised when high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to therapy, be avoided on the day of therapy and minde- tens 2 days after treatment with pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib must be avoided, the simultaneous application with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy calls for increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use in pregnant women, but as with older antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pendietrexed may not be used during pregnancy unless it is mandatory and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm relationship.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed exceeds mother's milk and unwanted effects in the breastfeeding infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma, and in 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by disrupting sandwich and acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed works as an antifolate with several attack points by blocking the thyroid synthase (DHFR) and glycinamine dribonucleotide for- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purtin cleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin have had a clinically meaningful advantage over those patients treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In both studies on patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on anus, flatus (winch) with stools, stuhldiness, oily / oily bowel, abrupt secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be applied to patients treated with Ciclosporin (for preventing organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or high-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before beginning a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as pharmaceuticals for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">Additional pregnancy prevention measures are recommended to prevent the failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with concurrent use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (international standard ised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained normal.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a one-time dose Amiodarone, a marginal decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of unwanted side effects found after the launch of orlistat is unknown, since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch, there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on investigations on humans and animals, rapid feedback of any systemic effects caused by orlistat's lipasinhibiting properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect works in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastri and pankreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials suggest that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times daily, blocks absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalisch, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their output weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value of 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral dosage of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after splitting the N-Formyl-leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients who showed approximately 42% of the overall plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of alimxi can be increased by the additional application of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was examined for 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are powerful or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies that are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate stimulator for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: in order to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in case of severe emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer illness and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting due to a cancer illness.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alimxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon inflammation, patients with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection should be closely monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to other chemotherapeutic applications, in the days following chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not block the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous dose of palonosetron and a Steady-State- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinoin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups showed themselves; there were no dose-effective relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been performed because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an overdose of Aloxian.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, or 100 mg dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) received intravenous day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg ondansetron which were given intravenously day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from studies with moderately-etogenic chemotherapy and the study of strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular deformation and replication and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration, a gradual elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a gradual elimination from the body with an average terminally half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.390 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous injection of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the palonosetron plasma concentration measured in 11 testicular carcinoma was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron measured on 3 consecutive days, total current position (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after a one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, are involved in the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection in healthy subjects, total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but this does not justify a reduction in the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposure to exposure, which is considered sufficient above the maximum human exposure, indicating low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Thanks to preclinical studies, indications pointed out that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular deformation and replication and can prolong the period of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30times of therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given over two years daily, led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasma (thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosage and since alxi is determined by humans to one unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicine").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (prolonged) hepatitis C (hepatitis C caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue shows damage, furthermore, the values of the enzyme alpha aminotransferase (ALT) are normalized in the blood abnormality.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it in the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheon manufacturer presented data that attest to the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared to 455 patients with the efficacy of the reference doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after receiving the treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood reported).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-business purposes only provided by the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed may not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded in more patients than with the reference doctor; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection resulting with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinseed resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was noted that in the treatment of abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA, it is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect of Altargo (which has been observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks associated with the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be broken off, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary open wounds the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skinsked skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% reapamin- ointment increased by 81% of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered when topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral ingestation and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and foetal / post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to administer systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding continues / ends or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefits of breastfeeding should be weighed for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side-effect irritation at the administration which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Impact Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromuttilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50's bacterial ribosome, which differs from interacting antibacterial substances from binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partially P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms seem questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% of Retapamil Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% of Retapamin- ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in adults before medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic image taken by humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of skinned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retapamines IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo analysis chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovivigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the authorisation for placing on the market obliges to carry out the detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the 1.8.2 module of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo unless prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is made of verandah on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and consult your doctor for advice if discomfort occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a Gazelle, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium pouch containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambiani is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambiani is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, where protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunisation and is ensured that the vaccination plan can be concluded from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines function by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can fight against disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the recently approved twin-rix vaccine, and the recently approved "Twinrix" vaccine that has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix grownups contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix grownups were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month period and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambiani took between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambiani may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the basic immunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">When a fever vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully ensured whether immunocompetent individuals who responded to hepatitis A vaccination need a fresher up as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory even in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation pattern with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units with a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemmodialysis patients and individuals with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal outcome in the gluteal muscle, these injection methods should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambiani can be injected subcutaneously because in these cases it can come to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturability, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomersal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were given to Ambirix in a total of 1027 vaccines ranging from 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and weariness on a calculation basis per Vaccoun Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after Ambirix's administration at 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects given Ambirix were suffering from pain, compared to 63.8% in subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who were given Ambirix, compared to 36.2% of the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- and 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of the form-ininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not different statistically.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines ranging from 1 to 15 years of age, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose administered (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose administered (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 received two doses Ambirix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2764">Among the 289 people whose immunogenicity was selectable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1-11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be shown 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year coincides with the discovery of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular pertussum, inactivated poliomyelitis type b vaccine, or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults demonstrated similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine may be examined both before and after the resuspense on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix does not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses (although you / your child feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin rather than into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your own body's defences, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambiani can be given in these cases, but the immune response of those individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you have received / received other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you have received / or your child been vaccinated recently, or if you have received / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, it should be inoculated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Normally, Ambirix does not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to vaccinate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 blunted dosages): • Pain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Matness • Reitenability • headache • Appetite deficiency</seg>
<seg id="2798">Very common (up to 1 case per 10 tapped doses): • swelling at the injection site • fever (above 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Further side effects reported that days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 used doses) are reported, are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extended rashes which may itch or vesicle, swelling of the eye part and face, breathing breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure loss and loss of consciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Impotence inflammation of some blood vessels discomfort or illness, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain, inflammation of the liver, elevated inclination to bleeding or bruising (bruises) caused by the decrease of the amount of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2803">23 Keep your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects affect you / your child or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package.</seg>
<seg id="2804">Ambiani is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was put into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastropostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the lead tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose to the stomach of the leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since ammonia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active agent).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, an abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste dysfunction, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonia was approved in" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because only limited information on this drug was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested itself in newborns (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delay-resistant form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if there is hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake necessary for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbabylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine deficiency syndrome have to receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate are administered via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, curry topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylalglutamine which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Externally seen, phenylacetylalglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylalglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylmethglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitric excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Survival rate was 98% in patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the OrnithinTranscarbabylase deficiency), who recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylalglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobal metabolism and liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated gifts from oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous dosage of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) showed no phenylacetate in the plasma next morning following different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis who were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma stamp on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylalglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Following the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no indicative effects in toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children unable to swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomia or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbabylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, respectively 2,5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, curry topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Externally seen, phenylacetylalglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylalglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on tests on the excretion of phenylacetylalglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle, we can assume that, for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylmethglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate in granulate form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring scoop of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If your laboratory studies are conducted, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into the mother's milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, abandonment of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, feel free to contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS out of the same single doses or via a stomach fistula (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose that is led through the nose to the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a wooden tablespoon of granulat from the container. • Send a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess granules. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equal to one measuring spoon. • Take the recommended amount of tablespoons granulate out of the tank.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiogenesis is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "static uplift" (an abnormal measuring value in the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiogram is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angiogram in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiogram - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year overall just as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiogram was just as effective in all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding, where it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiogram may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalira, other Hiudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angiotoxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or when an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiotoxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous 0.25 mg / kg intravenous dose followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical need.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a cleavage of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus indication of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolt of Bolus was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before use and the dose dose can be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the dose of 1.75 mg / kg of infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalent against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of Bolusdose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT score was 5 minutes after administration of the bivalry bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiogram is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active agent or any other ingredients or against Hirudine • active haemorrhages or increased blood pressure due to a malfunction of hemostasis and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalidine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most hemorrhages in arterial puncture points occur in the case of PCI patients under Bivalidudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can generally occur throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalidine, monitoring of the INR value should be considered in order to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bivalidine reaches the existing level once again.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregations shemmer), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalents with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient in relation to effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or post-natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalidudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalira, plus GPIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalry-group and in the treated groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleedings performed significantly less often than in groups with heparin plus GPIa / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidine plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An Acuity severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage of ≥ 5 cm in the point of point, reduction of haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed, bleeding localizations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects are based on the data from a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalidine Group and in the treated groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalidudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIa / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with bivalidine is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalry, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as on the anionic binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether the thromboin is bound in the liquid phase or in the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The Binding of Bivalira to Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, for its part, slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalry with serum from patients in which the thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce a thrombocyte aggregation reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or the insulin can not work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two trials with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which insulin can not work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin pens.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or administered subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delaying, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or breakdown of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathetic nervous system such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanthidin and reserves.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed by clinical studies known to adverse drug usages, grouped by system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, may result in a lipse dystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by an appropriately trained person, or intravenous intravenous glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin also lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose consumption (especially skeletal musculature and fat), as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than with hu- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a dose of proportional, glucose-giving effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosity effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosity effect about 2 hours earlier than humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="2996">It was obvious from the data that a comparable post-pranic glycaemic control was achieved in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, better post-pranic control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with human regular insulin, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the meal begins (Figure 1A) and compared to human regular insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
