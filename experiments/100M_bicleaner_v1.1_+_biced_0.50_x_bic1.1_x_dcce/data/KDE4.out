package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them available more easily .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select settings extensions ... Open the map and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash @-@ module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available .
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in plot@@ ting ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower @-@ level objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries . therefore , large files , even then easily identified , can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour definition and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the depic@@ tion of another file property such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of child rec@@ tan@@ gles can be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; frames are drawn to show the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework needs space , which is then no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . hereby , it is advantageous for the ri@@ pen@@ ing and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles emerge that are as square as possible . the best methods in this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view viewing on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option pictures per line has a slider and a rotation box to set the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery .

view the file size check box and see if the file size is displayed in the gallery .
display the image size check box to determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialog folder &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders should be included . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the file selection save in HTML file , specify where to save the HTML page .
you can use the check box sub@@ folder to set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
the comment file is used to specify a comment file for the description of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provide easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation area or with the F@@ 9 key short@@ cut .
to play , click in the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
to change browser detection , add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with specific browsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses access to this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options .
change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this obsol@@ ete browser .

a simple to use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to review , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ tization ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make the detector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the Tro@@ ub@@ les@@ hooting system . all necessary information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam site , visit homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you hit &amp; digi@@ kam ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data sequence is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; look at each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during search of the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; needs to recur@@ sively exclude the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this lets you insert a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not take photos as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu .
how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
a simple to use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port is slow , this connection has become obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and carries the transmission of the pictures with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nail images may not be seen or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to see &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to provide K@@ photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; self @-@ perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB , or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and drop of images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ d , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name functions only if it is displayed in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date the album was initially created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album import pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . in order to access the album features , right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . selecting or del@@ eting collections from the tool@@ bar or adding albums to collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date with view records sort by date .
the buttons El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to this end , the average of the images is used from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; it should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select as album title . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be taken into account .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My key@@ word@@ list left in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be shown in the picture window . each picture is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all preview images .
information about each image will be shown below the associated preview . what information is this , you can change settings digi@@ ti@@ tes ; set up . select the albums page and adjust the preview pictures to suit your requirements .
the thumb@@ nails have help buttons that appear . if you click the mouse poin@@ ter to rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such an help window .
photos are all about digi@@ tization ; goes . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can reach all the functions that were done with &amp; digi@@ tised . you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Edit ... or selecting the right mouse button of the image . in the editing section , you will find instructions on how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu . to this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs can cause problems with the metadata already contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right @-@ click on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ders ; organizes your photos on the basis of data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et below in the data view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
tags include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords logical . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key words &apos; ; collapse so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for .
the tags are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . furthermore , the tags are re @-@ imported when the database is lost once &amp; digi@@ tization ; the images will be noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or on an existing keyword , and then select New keywords . if you cli@@ cked on a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting from the keywords menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as album title in the pop @-@ up menu . additionally , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My Key &amp; quot ; pull and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview pictures and choose from the keywords menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of keywords assigned to it . this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be displayed in the main window preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the right @-@ click context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only displays the tags that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a select box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower right of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will save a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your search request again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the search form appears again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog box appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select to delete the search in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are listed in line with search group / search group . an option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , K@@ eine ... or At least ... At least you can search the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can drag in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light@@ box in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em light table from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the Ligh@@ thouse and its window will be opened .
from the thumb@@ nail panel you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . when you navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the left @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies to work through a number of similar images .
of course , the normal fire @-@ fighting actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rotate the visible area of the image , you must click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold in the mode preview then both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom @-@ knob under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory administration - apart from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos creates a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use pictures again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ kam ; we focus on the procedures for digital photographers who use &amp; digi@@ kam ; we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ or@@ ised , ass@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tures , and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data that provides information about or docum@@ enting other data that are administered by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no inventory management to find a particular photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then use certainly not &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving , which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you interfere with your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger disk .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your data . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend using the metadata option to save metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam , which ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change some ? added &amp; digi@@ kam ; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign any photo keywords , labels and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in further work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , key words , as you often say in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalogue pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are followed by &amp; digi@@ kam ; refres@@ hed while it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let your photos be seen simply , they want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you consider it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ ute ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dreaming , having associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides a sp@@ ell@@ chec@@ ker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that can be opened with Goo@@ gle@@ Maps . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam : should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this may be titles like : hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , here the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , li@@ fes@@ pan , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious topics must be treated and you may not be trusted more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in stock quality that last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion space .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s yet . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
please read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it in a clean , dark , dry and protected environment . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
Disk@@ builders keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
in short : disks are the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temper@@ ar@@ isations , the error rate increases dramatically . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors are the most common cause of failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices make electric sho@@ cks not much , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed sensors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , hardware switch , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and removes the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this ensures a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sp@@ urs that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even an failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply .
besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system to run down . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in electricity interference with the cost avoid@@ ance of this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering that allows you to store any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ aster @-@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all of these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at present , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ s file system . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data in the not@@ ebook and 46 % on the work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks are already 50 % for not@@ ebooks .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation space : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the complete house .
this is why Des@@ aster Pre@@ vention always means not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been changed . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike scripts @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , sync only the difference of the files that have really been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original kept , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ covering images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace G@@ IF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ vis@@ as data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there is relative a lot of administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images of high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open format format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and obli@@ ges to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &quot; ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a blend of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there can be problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI workshops , standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera editor , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . it may be cut off from other programs .
use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , code in MPEG , use contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Ad@@ ding a Photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera , connect it to your computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a completed indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not provide preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
the Ri@@ der Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the &amp; digi@@ kam window ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all the photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired by using the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the selected button is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you download all the buttons , a dialogue with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folder is sorted . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , then you have to select them first and then delete selected ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were downloaded successfully into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ utilized after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording studios to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image was made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the default format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for more adap@@ tations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically if you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam , use this to automatically load sub@@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam , the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced tab and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position specified in length and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click , which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; users want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ites and map references . so the question is actually more how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographical attri@@ bution ( manual ) and finally through manual entry of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a couple working with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that uses the Ex@@ erc@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the call@@ sign @-@ ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over his workflow as possible . there are many settings that change behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing , so that you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; note , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected from the camera interface when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be names such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . by doing so , it is reached that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam , without going to be lost .
save image descriptions as embedded labels ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the descriptions embedded in the pictures . this allows your labels to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; alb@@ um@@ folders that have none of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button on the right of each category .
you can set the default values on this page . however , some images have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some images have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ y@@ quot ; you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation .
with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not decrease image quality since P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF option , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality because the Def@@ late algorithm is loss@@ less .
with loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it develops very quickly into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights . use the setting of passing white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results because it displays the pointed lights in various pink tones . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ws to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a matter how much colour or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the digital image options . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data , which comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which is a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening correction as you are done during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a colour space in the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions If a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files will start .
color profile folder can be found here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t fix for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left @-@ hand side . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring them to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can manually set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the discussion of &amp; digi@@ tization ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ tising , if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without using any backward queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; at startup it speeds up &amp; digi@@ kam the start process ; .
setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos will force &amp; digi@@ kam ; searching the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ tising , to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar using Settings Design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by clicking and selecting the entry / editing item .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original picture before using File Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file storage .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing button in the tool@@ bar . you lose every change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last store .
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . you can undo the last action by modi@@ fying or restoring Edit back or restoring Edit from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and restart C@@ tr@@ l ; switching to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , click on the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , down image or using the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the An@@ sich@@ ts menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : zoom magni@@ fication factor
view full screen mode . you get to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool bar will be displayed . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; change it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire sets . entire image preview images can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ porter Print As@@ sist . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again to the edge .
in the label view , you can type or insert labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sor@@ tation . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the rating is written in gency in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; -@@ session applied keywords .
the Key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering keyword in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed by marking the relevant check boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC keyword keyword .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their Album , - date , keyword and search results is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right Key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place every time the program starts . it can also be switched between different settings .
if you have a rule with and created , and notice that it needs to be one or its , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner come with a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work@@ . additionally , you should make sure to make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other image editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should I use another color space and think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor as s@@ RGB depends on your monitor . if you are working as the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , align , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values across the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its colour shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
equi@@ libr@@ ate : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ous function of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in one image or destroyed it .
automatic balancing : this method maximizes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge Con@@ tr@@ ast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted as a colour space is working with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image . the preview will be adapted dynamically to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original image again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
a hist@@ ogram is shown to the right of the picture that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this happen . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour @-@ mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instruction for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Administration .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to store your settings so that you can use it for more photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the gra@@ dation tool that allows you to find gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam utility color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was a result of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the ion@@ ization . at approximately 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a projected colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ ag@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light at the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
when you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue : a too big satur@@ ation . in this case too , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is setting sound value correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you only need the scope of the slide . more concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use the control is to shift the controller and to take care of how the picture changes .
on the right side you can see the original and preview of the image . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often the most useful . if images contain large areas of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic arrangement is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts .
the three color pin@@ ched pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original picture to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to adjust the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and re@@ charged later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , medium and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values to the red , green and blue channels of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right hand side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , linear mode is most useful . in this case , linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a part section to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes automatically create the verti@@ ces of the curve for all channels of shade , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find over@@ exposed pixels in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the h@@ ues of the images . you can edit it from the Edit menu color mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are on the right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ anz the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the disc@@ la@@ imer . it consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same location in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if this is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can store any mixer setting for later and then load it . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer .
the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz stays activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as ink pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolls profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ LE@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a little cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ qui@@ eter . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ ut@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , no matter if it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : use this parameter to set the desired frame type for your image . completely surrounded the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : width of the frame in percent . the width of the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image which is decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before cutting .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any point . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text item , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it . the larger the image , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you press OK . after the image has been saved once , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
using the &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply mould template you can put a template across a picture .
the picture template menu apply in image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam file , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the preview tool@@ bar automatically .
below are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
reduce : this knob reduces the image below . it is centered around the mouse position . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it doesn &apos;t shar@@ pen any bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing may be the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is the result of the digital@@ isation process colours with minimal differences to one color point . this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit bl@@ urred . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter already while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call this by the menu entry Cor@@ rection Cat@@ ching .
you should deal with this however carefully because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but enhances also the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . under re@@ focuss@@ ing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to make soft characters with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren soft draw and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ en@@ ades will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference @-@ amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined with it to be applied for an edge of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and hence beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted un@@ fold filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to shar@@ pen an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a sharp@@ ness mask . re@@ focuss@@ ing achieves usually better results than un@@ sharp mask . you can start it from the menu by invo@@ king colors re@@ focuss@@ ing in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ urred but should pay attention to receiving sli@@ ps .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos; is . this is most often caused by a previously executed bl@@ ur filter . in most cases , you should make this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matri@@ ces Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in matri@@ ces size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , mis@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ness .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . for the Vienn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for Archi@@ ving in Digital Images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ thing knob sets the sharp@@ ness of the area dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desirable art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to fine tune the filter settings , you can use tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should preserve details so that no sharp@@ ness is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail keeping should always be subordin@@ ated to directional depen@@ dency .
direction depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD noise will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . so set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step size since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , there should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more in quality you receive by choosing this option is only low . however , it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to leave it out .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this happen . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photograph taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the background that caused by a bad movie placement during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mock acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing of the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubrication will occur again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more pronounced , but it also adds the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjusting of phase shock absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to make soft characters with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren soft draw and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of un@@ desirable art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film bas@@ kets , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local defects that occur in digital , original , or later digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce compression : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make this happen . any adjustment of photo restore can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo Rest@@ oration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button .
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film kör@@ ú@@ t on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel &amp; quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the preview preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all thumb@@ nails .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbour pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ spot correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ ing@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many centre filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed , which is impossible to keep the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise imp@@ air effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and colour or grey scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying a equivalent transformation to a raw screen made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ ting applies the transformation with a c@@ rank filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
you can control the vi@@ gn@@ ite correction filter with three regul@@ ators and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ strengthening atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density of the filter . standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , resulting in compens@@ ating the density around a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reducing it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the correc@@ ting of the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree measures the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar ro@@ unding effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . negative values can be corrected t@@ onal distortion and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the Paramet@@ ers General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in correction of first gra@@ ft . increase negative values while positive image size decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ ne and cushion @-@ like correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . in the best way , you perform this correction as the first one . if you re@@ ap a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ like correction , the effect is evidently the wrong .
to help you find the best correc@@ tions , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ able cro@@ pping out of the image processing or the Zoom controller of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs like shots from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is reachable under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can see the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Ad@@ ding film gran@@ ul@@ ator if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows will white like snow !
since the filter bl@@ ends color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing .
this is an example of infr@@ a @-@ red filter design applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image receives a timeless ambi@@ ance from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny looking especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film licensing effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensi@@ bility corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a cab@@ bage . the lines that define the outlines in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adapting the intensity value .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : similar to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the image here is distorted by another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom uncertainty : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from a center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixel around a center point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : taking photos from a car or train , camera .
bl@@ urred bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
vibr@@ ating bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image by random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives you natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by mirr@@ oring or turning in the right direction . the tools for this purpose can be found in the Trans@@ former menu of Tur@@ ning or transforming mirrors .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transforming size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase the image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo blowing was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the Ri@@ der New Size and are listed below :
retained aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . to increase any photo size can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement .
editing a photo is not just a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a picture you just need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save menu in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the range for cutting to the highest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio , its settings will save depending on image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the matching help allow help to fade in , so that you can put your images together better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ party gel , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden mid : the golden centre is a division that has different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre .
the golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the viewer &apos;s gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
one more rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to guide the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is directing at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place a static object can be released more dynamically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus on one of the angles and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and tool free rotation repair . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side of the screen .
for your help , the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ing cro@@ pping from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . but notice the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed around a point of reference to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective the image will be a little lubri@@ cated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble tri@@ angular holes at the corners . a way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping from the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal loop , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can rotate horizontal and vertical at the same time . when you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are bl@@ ended . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is bl@@ urred a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two dra@@ fts produce twice as much inter@@ ruption and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cro@@ pping from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam ;
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; only shows files in formats that know . this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the image processing will change . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept change . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw picture format , you can read in English on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw picture converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page .
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; does not understand these formats and will preview or edit movies for movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to launch the program to play playback .

if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description follows here .
all picture editing tools such as sharp@@ ness , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise reduction , re@@ focus , im@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower in comparison to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the image you want to see . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all the settings of the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar properties show the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can drag in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your images Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and finally used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection . in order to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color table on the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected .
a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you will find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs that contain &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are out@@ dated and X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ ph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ vi@@ z ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ unds ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; kate ; open or graph in &amp; c@@ alli@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Plac@@ ement ; -@@ component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than this k@@ not )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph . needs are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen@@ shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the ph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; c@@ low@@ viewer ; -@@ instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the currently running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to one side are to be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without head@@ line and with a different font
the renewal site gives the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening page gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ er ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the site administration page gives the option to specify the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or do not ) or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , usually displayed with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph . it produces representations in accordance with the sprung model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm subordin@@ ates the no@@ des circular to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .

if you change the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at Maximum size .
the Maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size will change so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie export has no documentation at this moment . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed on a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to manage a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data that were included in the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the maximum time devi@@ ation setting gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera distance . if the devi@@ ation below will be merged , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge the si@@ e.@@ Fu@@ el it over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be switched between Card Mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages up to 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that want to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded to UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab in which the settings can be adapted . the tab allows you to select all albums that want to be exported to HTML . you need to select these albums only . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ dex@@ show
the tab Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other Color Dep@@ th you can change the default color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . therefore , you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ing . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed as default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ er @-@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases as no compression of color information takes place . this can be found , for example , at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you have cli@@ cked on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of slide show .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
first you need to select the images that are to be packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth picture changes .
the background color can be set up next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can set the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep as close as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie by coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee quickly or in all peace and enjoy the slide show if you are back again .
if a note appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tool and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right down .
the Print As@@ sist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ mp . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image . with the thumb@@ nail , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as G@@ amma , Bright@@ ness and Red / Blue Amp@@ li@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time . use this mode if you are sure , for example by testing on a single image that is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will be selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size , and background color , will be adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the picture window is displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent .
the button pictures remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as attachments .
do not take care of sending too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be attached to a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Picture File format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original @-@ export data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status noti@@ fications , on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it using Es@@ c .
the images random@@ ly choose ensures that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends , however , on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . at random , every transition between the images el@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in every group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current preview images .
when you press persons with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown . through this selection method you can limit the number of shown images of a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save their own thumb@@ nail , this is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the upcoming context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and display the item @-@ editor in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog in the picture once more .
if you enter a string into the Description field or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date that will be searched ; the date can be either a part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots , and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the shown entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture will display this date in preview preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , only pictures of this time frame are displayed in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .

first enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . you will find information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download any images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a bigger picture , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages are created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , right , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the above settings have all three on base folder or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time looking at the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do any more .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file , or if there is only one connection to images in the file . the advantage to save all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can share this file as independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file looks for the images in two ways . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ in file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
in the manual , you have to copy the images to the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album with the Automati@@ cally option to the .@@ k@@ im file ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option Export File .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , will &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the im@@ porting assistant consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons to the imported file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database . you can see an example of this on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and viewing up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your images , but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future starts . if you want to read a different folder tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview settings and the options for the viewer . a detailed help is available for each setting , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define various properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to process existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group at one time in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but they are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are used together with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before applying them to your own images The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can either be accessed via the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order of albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all the pictures showing you the picture preview at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also include a list of albums . here &apos;s a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people for example , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do so , so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and a tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but first click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image was taken , etc . you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is shown and all images were recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , therefore , that the names used are moved up to find and classi@@ fy people faster .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list .
if you have ann@@ ot@@ ated notes for each image separately , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the ones before and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window displaying the USA as an over @-@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to select this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a box by moving it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which offers you , among other things , the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then hide / hide the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the delete button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images to record images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask for the inser@@ tion of the CD . if so , if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the pictures .
in the picture menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that at the end those left you want to make for others and click the Current View menu in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see , control and unlock the menu item All except current view .
this allows you to determine which pictures should be hidden in case of a case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply tick the menu entry pictures , so that all the images you have blocked will be hidden . if you want to display the images again , click Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select the password in the Privacy Settings menu .
please bear in mind that this picture @-@ protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to withstand the view of private images .
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to consider them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have downloaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be accessed from the contex@@ tual menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus . started and stopped the slide show through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful feature of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
use the Min@@ us button to zoom into the center of the image and zo@@ om@@ t in the center of the image , showing how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
the point button allows you to reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Frequ@@ ency button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus temperatures .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ate the current image using the menu item Not@@ ices from the contex@@ tual menu .
when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to just mark the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with characteristics as you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this picture you can see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have added features to your images , they are available in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , just tag all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right now .
categories and special features can be displayed in thumb@@ nail . when you view categories in the thumb@@ nail view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint it on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in order to enable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to switch on , select On the picture from the contex@@ tual menu . to exit the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but you should have read and understood the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ model views are shown yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the Edit menu bar , or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered attributes , click App@@ ly to take over these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or reject the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a stage of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object , or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when selected , or their stage of view is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below an existing view , pull the tap to the top or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle shows then the new position .
to create a new column , drag the tap to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of that view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tra@@ cker at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the tap on the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left in the summary bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the summary bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with view window arrangement ... save it . there will be a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ ders . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering the tool@@ bar or select View Sc@@ ene menu item .
a render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes as you want , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender settings menu , the following dialog will be opened :
every render mode has a name . you can enter any name , it makes sense but a name that lets you see the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality combination , you can select the properties , which &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting . detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or scale effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling does incorporate the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is distributed over and over again and adap@@ tively because the rec@@ ur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and examined for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams down a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated rays did not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly ended , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full range of commands of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version here . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the windows type .
you can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and rotation .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
when you cross high level of detail for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the ground , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours .
when you tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangement section , it explains how to create and store window arrangements .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window classi@@ fications . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the Exist@@ ing window classi@@ fications displays all existing window classi@@ fications . a new arrangement can be created by adding the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the button Clear .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view does not anchor in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; inst@@ alls and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will have to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the property tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button on the user or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert the Fin@@ ite Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an understandable way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the property tree , change the name and then click the App@@ ly button or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view now shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object . then you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tab . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button thumb@@ nail to see how the pigment looks now .
of course , you can preview the pig@@ ments only a matt black material , because you still have to make adjustments for the pigment . keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header or sphere in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then go to the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you change your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colors you expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change the colors in the object properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the sphere can be just as simple as the ground :
in the view of the properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ted black material . in the following step use a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
select first sub @-@ object and change the name , for example , in ball pig@@ ments . click on the pigment pigment , then choose single @-@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not at all selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers you . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scen@@ eries .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog can impact . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you created beforehand with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet stored changes in the scene .
repeat the recently rever@@ sible command . you can only select this menu item when you have used the Un@@ do Un@@ do button .
store the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and the default behavior .
open a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to create rough surfaces without having to model any hi@@ ves on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
using &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ing@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can adjust if any image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ act ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option save &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; clo@@ ak show ; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user will contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you problems or desires . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page to report problems and wishes . all information you need is filled in , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto , is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developers mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over its workflow as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto . to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings show@@ photo ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over @-@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should be contrasting with what you are supposed to view . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto shows a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view the same page bar in picture editing . you can view this by clicking on one of the five hor@@ semen :
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning pictures that no longer makes it easier to scan and save images .
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning pictures that no longer makes it easier to scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image to save or save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; with the command c@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner has been specified , then a dialog will be opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not specifically handle these options .
in order to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview scan is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom to fit the complete preview into the window .
if the image is selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as seen below . if saving is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back into the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the picture , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; images save images . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this by button ... Change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is recorded each time a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality using to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE via dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs ke@@ yp@@ ad . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can be set up by right @-@ clicking into the player window and set up Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... Select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; specify the keyboard short@@ cut by right @-@ click into the player window and select short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this lets you make your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions that mostly also exist in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script does not work .
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the script / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts are written to the default input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure allows the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being picked up . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , the metadata or unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . in order to add an entry to the menu you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ate , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for instance , saving up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can optionally also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the creation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permission :
if your script package is ready , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok Categ@@ ory script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you will also find a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
but you may already have a few play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then , the playlist is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music .
usually , in the Amar@@ ok source folder , you have to type the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can activate or de@@ activate at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty through the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
display Player Window to turn the player window into or out of the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window is displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ l . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning @-@ bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ l . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
place mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
to save play@@ lists when moving , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces visible when changing the play , that the play@@ lists window will roll up / un@@ roll to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; selecting Custom Fon@@ ts will activate the otherwise gray shown section . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color schemes , you have the choice of choice and can design@@ ate your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector below for foreground and background color .
resume playback at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at last stop .
the On Screen Display sub@@ window allows you to set up the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is applied , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if your own colors do not use , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further adjustments in this map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music both the checked and their sub@@ folders .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browsers .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop @-@ down box Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another device is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is reached . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the cardboard card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current play .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performers will call : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers will retrieve the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you must have installed k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ os@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and leave the collection again .
mostly it is because Tag@@ li@@ ad crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens at a crash ) . if this is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but not as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l which &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok first finds the correct version .
most of the installation problems are easiest by the help of an expert to find your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also find help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ zilla is not suitable for help . please make only a mistake if you are experiencing a bug in Amar@@ ok &apos;s fault .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get into music ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the Start Screen has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools statistics .
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate items , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column View comment . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the actual issue must be supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 deco@@ ders in the default setting ( for pat@@ ent@@ eric reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the gam@@ er driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and to run audio at the same time . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. Col@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers run with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity@@ ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ D co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver but instead gam@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer at the Control Centre and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ amer responds to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the register register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( termin@@ ate Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download the peg , compile and install it . then run as@@ m@@ peg files , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ p@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you are arous@@ ed by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size @-@ changing window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button places a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button to search in the playlist will play the first search result and set the search back .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console there are many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . you will open a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read@@ out , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , ) , and &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . there , you can change the rating of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the item and Edit : select Review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog box .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release schedule that is not to match with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can find quite annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid any trouble , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in Kon@@ quer@@ or . launch kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install it again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a hint of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use a L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator register . then start Amar@@ ok new .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
setup Amar@@ ok ... Audio output to set the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable check on sound@@ card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be cared for . you may naturally like to take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tainer for arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection subsequently , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the button &apos;s button in the playlist window . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , then those play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking a playlist , you will get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select A@@ ctions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and press the play button .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audio CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Bur@@ n function is also available in the playlist . just click on one entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . here you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( eg R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the features of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your single @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . just below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
under the running text display , you can also see the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL @-@ button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from Classic to Techno , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the e@@ quali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you activate the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist for all &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of features deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the most excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the running piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be more em@@ itter in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first area in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to look at the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its rating .
to display cover images in the context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favourite pieces from this artist . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the contex@@ tual menu .
the last section , the artist &apos;s albums , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the highest level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the performer , and there will be another division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different performers .
group artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your tunes will first be sorted by genre and among them by performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This attitude works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by an album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
right under the tool@@ bar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you have different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . furthermore , you can of course also select your total collection , thus making the filter virtually eliminated .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This gives the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you achieve the same effect .
set items in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
for media players , add the pieces to the media player to send them to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - this will broadcast the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
( n ) Mo@@ ving files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
record label selection - Change the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards , the album is no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the Play@@ list Browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Smart Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
you can also add created Smart Play@@ lists . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer tracks to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a set URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than it is in the window , the holding of files can be difficult by simply dropping files . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist retains all of you to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces found that contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then wrap the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR scores : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries . the entries will then receive a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you can find the Add button with which you can add the playlist to the playlist .
next , push back and restore buttons . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , such as ren@@ ditions and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for access mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking twice in the respective display area with the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the General Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big entry into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details of the setup of these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click the playlist you want , drag them to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced with the new one .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Zu@@ fäl@@ lige Mix and Play@@ list mixes immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the Recommen@@ ded pieces will be added at the next bill , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
the New button cle@@ aves the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
here , enter any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while setting the ready @-@ to @-@ play pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on a script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and un@@ installing .
if you are looking for information for writing your own scripts , please refer to the writing section of scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . in order to understand the steps you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that when re@@ encoding to MP3 a bad quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a loss@@ less format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media on which the data should be burned .

the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the Wid@@ get Module . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news from the forums .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ co@@ der module .
fla@@ c : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder and external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t W@@ MA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without the norm@@ alization , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed by which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you &apos;d run file storage for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then reject between saving and changes . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not stored , just as if you called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what is to happen , as if you called File C@@ lose .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the root folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is this ? remedy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you more than aid so that you can see the files and folders existing on the medium .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows even without a project file copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create an image of a CD that you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this allows even without a project file the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . converting / com@@ min@@ ating a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the total ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . this dialog allows you to format a DVD + R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired instantly by pressing the pressing button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting of black edges .
this information is shown in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar will be displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
the top bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view includes open projects . the top bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; After selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard layout below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows the correct authori@@ z@@ ations to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; general program settings can be made here . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs will give you preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like this :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void Boot@@ C@@ dr@@ v ( ) void exec@@ ut@@ C@@ dr@@ v ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line : # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String English ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String The parent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folders :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Data / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many encoding ( compressed ) files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ der packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also to other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this needs to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all of these programs are already available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages must be installed that are needed . for example , if FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer &apos;s chapter gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handles the protection , it is not possible to avoid copy protection . simply avoid buying a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained later . this will ( hopefully ) lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , all of which is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step , for example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab@@ s . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the code settings tab in the setup view - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the standard . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like enco@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides fla@@ c there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG equipment is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = this setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / needed with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter must be added by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identi@@ fier in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the machine . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this kind of configuration , so it appears , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This may only know the program@@ mer who has verified the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more about it , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
to save the read @-@ only wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the enco@@ der &apos;s tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ der package needs to be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and write real on it , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) will be installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 stit@@ ches ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write permission on it ( eg ; try to copy something into it using the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; something that is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what each issuing &amp; CD ; must be repeated .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them with every read on a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device identi@@ fier can also be specified . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing records of the device labels for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map of General Settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information will be selected , so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load will be distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls bo@@ xed the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore just try yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; throw it out at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if only place on another drive is present . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all this is done in the same way as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , and under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of concur@@ rent wa@@ v files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will build a connection to the internet as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b want to pick up . the process described in this section must be repeated for each issuing &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for a &amp; CD ; with success obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b data . hence , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually entered instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive that has been defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then look for questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually invo@@ ke this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all songs of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with capital letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audio creator . this option is set up on the coding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the issuing CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the BO@@ M .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the tracks selected are read out . a simple click on the row switches on the selection of the piece . just make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when clicking the button Select the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on .
click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you see this error message when you try to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here for example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the MP3 format . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( but of two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; will talk today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ de multimedia files . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that many different programs call up has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still am reading ? even if only the Help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first launch of the program , without any indication as to continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? whoever reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke game of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time representation of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound Project Driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the process used .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and running with the controller back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and thus change the playing speed . in order to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which one song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set it manually . so if you select an automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the Kara@@ oke text will be selected automatically . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select menu items or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played after the series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection below the point Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then adding the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired object in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when applying the application , this collection is not saved . remember , if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the Add button . it appears in turn to the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automatic add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub @-@ menu selection sequence of the main menu , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to continue a song , select the next song button , the next song from the menu item , or press the arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the previous piece , the previous piece from the menu item , or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all events of type change to B@@ right Piano into events of the change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when it was originally supposed to play a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; The name of the key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section speci@@ fies how General MIDI &apos;s patches can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
note that the left side of the par@@ ity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional all Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun . to do so , you can add the following to the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term &quot; drum patch &quot; the patch is meant , in which each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , tank , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . for example , take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply use the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name for this channel is needed . if you use the key@@ map option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which gets a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a ton higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a full range of keyboard ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to produce very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable setting automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to do programming , collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid , completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get any money for it . I would like to stress that I will only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .

of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , television and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , choose from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during start and end can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will keep the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ .@@ ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / &amp; lt ; / body@@ .@@ sr@@ c = &quot; meet , &quot; supported by S@@ MI@@ L , supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the buffer size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ zilla module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to enable the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player module must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments from K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to run in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this needs to be done by changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the device to use and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player is to use the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be identified ports from which one is selected .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , different names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ spr@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ l , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ anners , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after the device is connected . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be checked for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is obsol@@ ete . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is used to compile &amp; box ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is prob@@ able to use the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; and / tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the box ; web page .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be established .
if questions arise or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed on the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the opportunity to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to experience its possibilities , the hand@@ book to Kate should be drawn . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; posters .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ y ( engl@@ .@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex is given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
as well as other mark@@ up languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the most general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ documents { document } and must be closed again using the command \ \ begin { document } .
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; Report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 coding as default . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be known ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , Review ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is only a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le ; it is highly prob@@ able that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is highly prob@@ able by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is spar@@ ed you by high@@ lighting time and utility .
with automatic completion of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates an empty line ( for the input of the text ) and the associated line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI file . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; device independent file &#93; &#93; has been created &#93; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the official output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the code search , the items of the DVI ; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an item has been cli@@ cked on in the DVI ; file is bo@@ unded to the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding place is jumped in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be selected for project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ med &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the n@@ der@@ e.@@ â and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be displayed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of joint elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders for sub@@ division are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the selection box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; More &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the options available are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection box ) .
when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; boxes ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . you can specify the font profiles for the main text , the reference notes , etc . there are the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting up the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the fon@@ ts . if the font names are not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is using the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the push button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; box ; stores the storage automatically .
if the document comp@@ iles , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if fast construction should be used &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should also be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging of the document should also be considered .
an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with let@@ tering is created and only a few columns should have another font .
the changes are reported only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities for obtaining the read@@ ability and ease of user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the document .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is available until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be recur@@ sively presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
following the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few passages in fat and ital@@ ics , and a poem will be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a device @-@ independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like Pr@@ inters , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of a document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre @-@ search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern under Settings box needs to set up ... Tools Buil@@ dings can be selected .
to search for pre @-@ search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer is then executed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ... Editor )
if you don &apos;t open a quick installation of the &amp; DVI file , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window .
the log file records the source of errors in the source code . in the editor you can use the laun@@ cher La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the logging file always speci@@ fies the line where the error appears . in order to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; box ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
if you choose empty document , you can either re@@ write a document from scratch or use the wizard to create a new document . for more information , see the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file needs to be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings General can be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have to be executed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and you will be bored through the steps described below .
&amp; box ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and ex@@ iting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual about Kate should be drawn . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command reference , which can be accessed via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; word meaning that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ authentication only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with a printed left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can enter into additional jump marks . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¤ der editing ho@@ cks or the corresponding ke@@ yp@@ ad mean the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this also highlights this jump stamp , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already excellent possibilities offered , in &amp; box ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection , the following commands for text selection are included :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bending problem in &amp; box ; is that the files are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning since this command is also available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a hot spread ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document it can be washed first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description of Edi@@ ting Parts .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible straightforward work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , spra@@ ys will be spra@@ yed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are intended by brackets { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is in front or behind the gra@@ zing bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , the group will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups cl@@ amps , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference signs are used as G@@ Ã ¤ n@@ se@@ spro@@ uts . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple reference signs . also for ending the application the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and add two other signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double call@@ sign can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; input button for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but also the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a complete new@@ line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users would like to classi@@ fy the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; box ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab does not belong to the associated line , &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already providing a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three different modes available . all these modes can be configured for different working methods under Settings box ... completely set @-@ up .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the \ \ end { Environment } command after an empty line ( for text ) .
when the key is pressed , the last letter of the input is removed and , unfortunately , the mailing list is deterior@@ ating . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be incorporated into these positions , so that an easy jump to these positions can be made possible by using jump marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste boun@@ ce mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings box ; set up ... boxes ; All settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders as well as dictionary of general language use .
command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call of full @-@ state mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the full @-@ length mode over the menu @-@ editing environment or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the ambient comp@@ action can be continued in the simplest way and can be terminated by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be included .

&amp; Ki@@ le ; support user @-@ defined lists of canc@@ ell@@ ations that are immediately replaced by a more expensive string . lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be set up completely . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word sub@@ stit@@ uting over the menu with full length or key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large @-@ scale books are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been as@@ cer@@ tained that many people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; the full @-@ length compensation for all required devices .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled completely . here , the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the full length .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphics dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog allows graphics to be as simple as possible . to overview the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be followed and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re @-@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all tools are grouped in groups in the compilation compilation , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key @-@ key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using Command Pro@@ files , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be submitted for the project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ oc@@ r project file .
the script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ Ma@@ Script code . scripts can be managed over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet end@@ lessly developed and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be noted that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a fairly sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tual ; are supplied with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex . it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; box ; delivered documents and for a graphic upper surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working area environment . &amp; box ; is also a part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; box ; also on &amp; Mac ; installed with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . you can edit signatures in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig . using the command @-@ line interface , you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signature , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . due to many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . as a result , you will receive a LT ; empty signatures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and paste in the bottom section your new signature . signature example Kon@@ qi con@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click on the disk symbol Save .
you can create as many signatures as you want . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . do we lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more reli@@ ed on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML @-@ processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the folder folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has been working on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then just leave the current work folder . if not , then select up @-@ to @-@ date work folders and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if there is an issue on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported error and try again .
if the file to be tested is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you just hook up the current file . if not , delete the tick in the current file and select the file to be tested using other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check option .
for using a &amp; DT@@ D ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of &amp; DT@@ D ; using Defin@@ itions UR@@ I ; definition of definition UR@@ I ; in file selection necessary .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you just select the current file . if not , remove the selection from the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
specify the name of the file as the result should have . normally , the file is stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , la@@ det , have a lot to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . by this the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ part , we start with the menu plu@@ gins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path for searching the plug @-@ ins .
often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the statement of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and serves to uniquely identify .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking at the team member from the list and press the button &apos; Set &apos; button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will appear fat after which you are : text .
nick@@ name and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in regards to messages and notes . see further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to be made to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
insert notes is simple . either the note entry from the Editor context menu can be selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the name of the assigned top name of the team member , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the area and sub@@ project lad@@ ders , the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , concerning tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
attributes are case @-@ sensitive : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , will be inserted for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
start and finish date automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic inser@@ tion of acc@@ ent notes : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
M@@ IME types : mim@@ ic types for the detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default values can be restored .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the window settings back to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and other / depending on the views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ etting layout command line parameter .
the warning message area serves to control the display of warnings by checking no more requests .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL and source text view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structure tree adjustments the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those with which no element has been found in the current document .
the range for setting short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded when editing to more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ clause is something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed by plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are third @-@ party applications , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following should be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located in a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be delivered to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load the component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ k@@ parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the entered information is correct . then , select the input if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be respected .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is requested , the execution will begin as soon as a request is provided .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible incor@@ rectly in functions and include errors .
assign the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility make from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic lists of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the tag . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ ting of tags into a document without the risk of a writing mistake .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible for other users to have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to reach the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ es the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but look at &amp; and lt ; Notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog top in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ Schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , reachable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c can be edited ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Re@@ verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New action leads to the same dialog :
the ke@@ yp@@ ad assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine the current ke@@ yp@@ ad can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even are the quick start dialog , or the different view in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ xt / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There is another special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID from the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to the default input . in the drop @-@ down field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value to the Output box :
when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to specify actions .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog when available , so that an input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Show other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select the size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view of the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will insert &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions to specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ lic@@ ant button and continue with other tags as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , add functions to tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialog via settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by bending all symbols to make sure everything works .
back in the correct folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , the second we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 , func@@ 1 , tag@@ 2 , tag@@ 3 func@@ 1 = func@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , look now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is directly refer@@ enced to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file , which is used to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you stated in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth dividing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or anyone else . in various places , there is an email @-@ sent menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , sending the tool@@ bar with email , in the contex@@ tual menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archives , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus works ; the contributions will be checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a cab@@ bage contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled in ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
the upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bars tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signi@@ fication . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Lo@@ ad and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are only available within a certain project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ des the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building views , the card reader with information and the tool@@ bars . please strike in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marker or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , help for word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is referred to as a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single tag , such as &amp; lt ; insert into their document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . now they can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate , open and ro@@ am in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with tab cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes , and documentation building views .
project Management is a powerful tool providing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it is possible to change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab@@ s at the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by email . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , send the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . for this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for this , be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , following , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; aff@@ or@@ ded to users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . through the program Com@@ mander , they can increase productivity without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any scrip@@ ting language syntax . ( more on this they will find in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has been rapidly expanded into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details in the details are help : / Qu@@ anta ( either type this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or execute help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a fast @-@ access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; en@@ rol@@ ment , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; en@@ roll@@ ment , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
training and en@@ roll@@ ment of the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ sor &apos;s position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu based on the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings actions ... and you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows you to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu includes a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . smart insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the above menu items . click on it . click on an activated plu@@ gins de@@ activated .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the posters ; version .
choose the type of new@@ line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes takes time or may cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the tab mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains one entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , there are details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and modify the sequences .
this should create a help in the context of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can later be selected using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. PHP ; , Python , etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a project is started from scratch , not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hooks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if a project is started from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button .
high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) can be set in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking on its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders beha@@ ves as well , but the entries open and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by program@@ ing . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk do not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog box if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . usually this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , that is , by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool@@ bar in the project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the Tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are st@@ ack@@ able by the menu tool@@ bars . usage and addition differ . adding tool bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , it can remove other actions such as tool@@ bars , ren@@ ame tool bars , or adjust tool bars , which can be displayed , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action mach@@ ined that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and setting actions to set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , about the constraints one imag@@ ines for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to usage .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . for more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents will be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can easily find some examples in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , conden@@ sed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As local template ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check out the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn simply by dra@@ gging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : just copy the file to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop , or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ type he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynamically using &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / templates / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the contex@@ tual menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as the si@@ ghtly attribute is inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except for the root folders in the template . if a root folder is set to default , it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to complete a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is running synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 will activate this mode , this mode is already active , offset the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor is configur@@ able via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keyword keywords on the name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS Style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the mark works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the touch button or the distance button .
inser@@ ting tags will be made in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags will not remove already existing identical tags , i.e. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other for@@ ging anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table wizard or the Listen @-@ Assistent are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be pursued .
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; comp@@ iling successfully requires addition &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already available during a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , you can set the wai@@ ste stops in a specific file and line number and later be activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without arrow keys . file names in the same folder as the top load file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template called QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ cloud that contains the template .
every nam@@ esp@@ ace in the stated &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after stopping point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each passage .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll with the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass composite phrases as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; an argument is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template consisting only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts during merging .
the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed clearly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name but exist in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog allows for manually typing file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog shows your selection and shows it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C however a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when combined , the input field is active for target and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before starting / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you need to create two corresponding files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text in a comparative window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these default settings can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color which differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare single cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . when the line breaks is activated , the line is scored on broken lines .
the result window ( below the comparative windows ) has also an info line with the header output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ar &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes due to automatic merging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue is displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , when you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the options or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the release window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . by inser@@ ting the button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the section together and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navig@@ ating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture A@@ way / C@@ tr@@ l image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . if this is enabled , whatever you select , automatically copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and eliminating the manual copying . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the \ \ r \ \ r \ \ r \ &apos; new@@ line . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored to the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when activating this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be ast@@ ened . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button will automatically display an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of whit@@ esp@@ ace will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
when you press En@@ ter or Return , the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board automatically .
you can select which new@@ line type you prefer to save . pre @-@ set value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
comparing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step will not ignore each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when merging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; , but then files with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ side comparison look identical even though they are different . when this option is checked , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping ahead to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automati@@ cally Sel@@ ection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge . see for details on documentation to compare and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for encoding a short note appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress up@@ lifting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ co@@ ded transition column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to normal even a second check column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply shut@@ down the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
al@@ loc@@ ates the comparison windows side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . current file merge in the merge menu also works when you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will be passed to this external command first . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs . you can use this function for example to remove annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will be passed to this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line counting to convert your input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is a reg@@ res@@ sive expression that matches all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the substitution string moves to the found text in the first clip pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to create automatically generated text strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword substitution .
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line retri@@ eval . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to do several exec@@ utions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is retained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ off algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively using &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... direc@@ ts selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see further details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to fold out all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the name icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical , if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ n@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified , and if the option directories synchron@@ ize is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after merging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and hits the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , merging the folder cannot be started .
during the merge , one file is processed after another . it status column shows skill when the merge was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as the target , B is chosen as the target for two @-@ folder merge , and B and / or B will be used as the target for synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check afterwards whether all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries might be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut key ) . in order to merge only the current entry , select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge @-@ actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Buttons , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without making the really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , restart / continue directory merge / resume or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; encounters an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you attempt to skip the cause of the problem . thus , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging .
if some entries have been individually merged , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not be merged again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this can be set specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceded poin@@ ts@@ . a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
with links to files : if the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
if the option is turned on , the links will be compared to normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ ges@@ et and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is disabled by default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal . that can be useful when copying the chan@@ ges@@ et date . please use caution . this option is disabled by default .
activ@@ ates syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical . also , the results from merging files are saved in both folders . this option is disabled in the default .
if there are any differences , instead of merging the copy of the new file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and received extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of single files , not just merging entire folders . this option is enabled in the default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible at the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the option directory &amp; text windows to switch off main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory &amp; text box .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder .
however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transpar@@ enz using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders for opening , located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative and . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes via the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fiers date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modi@@ fying date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part display from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select View in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who went this way or would like to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . by default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines , next to each other , this will be more often the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor .
no sr@@ c has been removed after the text is removed ; no sr@@ c has been cli@@ cked , and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found in ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the Fol@@ der Fol@@ der of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the feature refresh . )
this also causes identical files to be copied when merging is not copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in the default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , finish them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries to set up ... and end . however , if an application is cli@@ cked within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu will also appear as well as the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ ises the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is checked , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
if this field is enabled , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is cli@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces will be shown to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ agers appear ; in a 2x@@ N screen , like from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal row , which is very well suited for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selecting the switch ... makes the dialog settings appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ es@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; K@@ mag to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you are reading a screen for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ments . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for using &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag increases the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are using the &amp; Shift key , press the button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Cri@@ min@@ ors &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; Co magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier to view a screen area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter holds on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury @-@ Syndrom ) and that every mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter holds on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the sheer discomfort of the mouse , pain may also be caused . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
is the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the drag at pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time has to pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . is this function activated , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this option is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of users .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off initially . if you then have become accustomed to the automatic click of the mouse , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware at which points a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . however , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the wheels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using an im@@ position , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click itself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input . thus , accidental clicking on the mouse button can cause unwanted reactions . safe zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice :
don &apos;t use the smart move when you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the text instead : hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . as a result , each time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button de@@ presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when the smart move begins the shooting time begins . later , you can use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X windows ; this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and they are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling action begins before the mouse button is released . in this way you can also drag and drop with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can let dum@@ b users talk to their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select phrases that are to be spoken once again from a list with the conversation history .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text . for more details , refer to the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text file . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up menu entry ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog includes two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site terminology and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the speech generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with which text is passed on to the speech generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to share the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as a standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for speech output depends on your language generator . you can find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using the possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pas@@ sage@@ way or in the playlist for text passages .
when you select In the input field , the selected text passage will be inserted directly into the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will be entered first only in the input field .
the second drop @-@ down menu allows you to specify whether the text should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed .
with the selection of text file say@@ ings , the book is saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text must be saved .
the word translation page contains a list of dictionary entries . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
using the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply calculated by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can combine the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or short@@ cut short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can only change its name .
adding actions like new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books can be accessed either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar , or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text will be cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory storage .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory storage .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry date .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the flash@@ cards ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival for free and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator driven in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as a standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :

the voice output dem@@ on from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further speech service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the language generator settings are only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust .
to set the settings , use the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the speech generator ) , but it depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t talk , can let text pass through the computer . it stores a list of already broken sentences that the user can spend time and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer a speech synthes@@ izer should be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service enabling any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Po@@ sters ; even if &amp; Po@@ sters ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
speech output is made using the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .

before you can use it , you have to install the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program and set it correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card Spe@@ aker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map general is displayed . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher would otherwise use the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
if you click on the flash@@ card driver in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the flash@@ card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the map and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language extension system by &amp; k@@ de ; click the tab General to open this map . here you can set up some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled to check voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control bar &apos;s system area , it disappears once the read is complete .
using the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , pause , and record text orders .
using the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; pre @-@ read cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an assignment .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the index tab General and check the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; first , you can read the text of the displayed website . first , check the text that is to be read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always wise to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also pre@@ viewed .
in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text shown above . first check , whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read before , and select the text in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Po@@ sters ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ats .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supported by a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for the string replacement offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wrong@@ ly stressed or er@@ ron@@ eous messages corrected . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml which is included in the scope of delivery is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filtering is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ schedul@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the screen reader is read , the retained jobs will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of warning .
news have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text read on a web site , you can greet someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . any job you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of lengthy texts which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for screen re@@ viewers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
character sets replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined strings of strings such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting news from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the subsequent setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for the setting of string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . case sensitive is not considered when comparing .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name at any time , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ rors . the list is processed from top to bottom in the order shown .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file that app@@ end entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to show a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , the application ID is displayed copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box App@@ ly filter apply . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s word . thus , words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs can be called for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the box sc@@ u@@ uti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ formers compile &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the filter selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker &apos;s characteristics , which the program proposes and sends the text to the speaker . with the speaker output filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will apply if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in typing .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected , which matches the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .

none of the above speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ XML ; but when using the module for festival pages , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to allow S@@ able to work at all . you have to do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing @-@ cat@@ chy is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out @-@ of @-@ date . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . also look at the web site of kt@@ ts ; search for information not yet contained in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos;s program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand your speech using a different synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and comp@@ ute , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program .
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code archive for k@@ de@@ vel or download the tar@@ ball you have created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ats , first use the speech synthes@@ izer to work properly , so you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program dict@@ t@@ ms@@ gr needs to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech schedul@@ ers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , pause or cancel the sentence .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can provide the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will be automatically selected the best fitting speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Spe@@ aker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , and then click on the list or click Edit , the map will display the Spe@@ aker Setup . as an example , the module will display the module for Festival Interactive . you will find details on the modules below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to Festival . when voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages such as ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and show this gray , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t leave these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized more quickly .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is checked , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the read .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence .
using the buttons in this row , you can proceed as set in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . screen re@@ viewers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts , click here .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or kt@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50 % , % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ 0s ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works for you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech contracts :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . if you are reading &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web site , you can come with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and screen re@@ viewers , there are no special actions when they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ats , read kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the map notification appears .
check this check box to enable read &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played by &amp; kt@@ ts are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sends whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats ; should do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is displayed on the list on the map speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications to a file . use the store button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Dis@@ order will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . moreover , trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can be done faster with the preview , since only the first set must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limits detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit identi@@ fier filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add additional pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , but it will get off from it .
the easiest way to learn how to select speakers by selecting them . switch on the language selection and enter text to read . check on the card selection , which spokesperson &amp; kt@@ ats ; select . switch on the speaker selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes . naturally , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start reading faster , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ ups and insert a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit detection filter preserves the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ agents .
if you have removed the normal set limit detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card reader selection , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words , no speaking abilities are specified .
use of the most appropriate subscri@@ ber that has all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select and dict@@ ate ; the speaker closest to the original features .
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything .
check this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area speaker that is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speakers button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ats ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , G@@ Stre@@ amer may not be installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ats ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . as a guide , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program needs to be so@@ x installed and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML de@@ formation filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ats ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more codes in front or back . orders are shown on the tra@@ il@@ bla@@ sted orders , the job consists only of one sentence . what do I do wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflict in the audio output . if your system is also part of this , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you stop a text order and then start another . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setup of the speech speed , but is otherwise not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ats ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar gri@@ pped archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
make install make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use it , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software to festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is normally included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option to set encoding to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 has to be set .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text di@@ phones . more information can be found here .
in this case additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the Fol@@ der festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for the use with Festival 2.0 the inser@@ tion of the error correction is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the Festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ( voice location &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS English Festival .
this procedure uses special code to issue the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PA@@ TH .

festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered speech synthes@@ izer which currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality .
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , select Fl@@ ite as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthes@@ izer sounds good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr .
load at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , -@@ page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame .
on the map set of speakers select a voice and place the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
epo@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ats , you can only adjust the volume in this speech synthes@@ izer .
start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the flash@@ card speaker click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the Epo@@ s programs are not in your PA@@ TH , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to obtain more information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ en speech synthes@@ izer , written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither pitch , volume nor speech speed .
the command module enables you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the speech output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) rather than sending output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux ; if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Option network settings at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose between the distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and best . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is possible only in system administrator mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . by clicking the button system management mode , you get to the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , all functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab :
the tab Network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from tab Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box set up .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will not require any further adjustment . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the field net@@ mask , the sub@@ net mask must be defined .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on as required . turn on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on your needs . turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS releases its name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed , or modified . entries can be added , removed , or modified . DNS records can be sorted in priority by selecting an entry and drop or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons down or down .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button ... It will display the dialog Edit .
the list of names in particular describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of known hosts includes some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will support . this still in the review version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click Add . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name @-@ known machine from the list and select Edit ... editing the dialogue with your hosts will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediate in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; console .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf / configuration files will be discussed .
in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 never found great dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assign@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary usage is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content as specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file will be re @-@ sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; split the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . realize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ sp@@ un on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detect &amp; k@@ dat ; it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by a change of the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape was resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band card must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting in &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you get format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy drives usually do not require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat , continue with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after the format@@ ting process is finished , the tape is automatically included and ready for use .
before you run the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens . in this dialog , you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup .
once you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ up process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have vali@@ dated the settings for recovery , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can re @-@ create the index in two ways :
in this way , a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set up the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders that are listed in backup files , only the files on the same fil@@ esystem are backed up , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is seen from tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file from the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ winding version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat before the tape is included , the command will load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the throw in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when releasing the tape , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected ; do not use this option in flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ supported log size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is computer name : seconds , where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have been format@@ ted since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows for quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the single options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not display you , and it will open instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably don &apos;t have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by selected criteria or entered strings . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All . in the default setting , the selection box contains the entry All . then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column . in addition , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so you will see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color as minutes lines of level note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned on setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to skip to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. where you can find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the Fol@@ der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for checking program start @-@ up when the system is run in &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . der &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it file was removed from there if there was one .
the sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start at boot time or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls go to r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the program in@@ it in various places and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . if you &apos;ve got something mess@@ ed up , then you &apos;ll get it repaired by re@@ launching the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; also , I could also have a user running level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand device is easy to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new area . in order to merely copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert them into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are recovered from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ level@@ n and now the machine re@@ starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services in these distri@@ butions are launched simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not meet any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg . ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up incor@@ rectly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that you can add it to this hand@@ book .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program lets you manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the Save menu in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two learning flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have limited space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will create a map on which you can make individual adjustments . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card password management appears when shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
this card will only appear if there is a limited fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) and is initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group file on the file system ) . parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited space restrictions listed in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with a limited space restriction .
the map group provides information about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ ary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group Di@@ alogue features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or a group , select Add from the user group or group , or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add the boot password , remove and change the time to boot from the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
