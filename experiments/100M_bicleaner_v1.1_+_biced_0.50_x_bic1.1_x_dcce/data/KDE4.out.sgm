<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras web page. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions depending on the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web sites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert text into translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them available more easily.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select settings extensions... Open the map and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash-module, click in & konqueror; on extras crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in plotting nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower-level objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries. therefore, large files, even then easily identified, can be easily recognized as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour definition and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the depiction of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of child rectangles can be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap in & FSView the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; frames are drawn to show the nesting of entries, and this framework needs space, which is then no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. hereby, it is advantageous for the ripening and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles emerge that are as square as possible. the best methods in this are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view viewing on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option pictures per line has a slider and a rotation box to set the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">The comment file is used to specify a comment file for the description of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provide easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; menu under the navigation area or with the F9 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">To change browser detection, add a menu entry in & konqueror, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with specific browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses access to this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this obsolete browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">A simple to use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, every medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to review, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitization; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make the detector of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the Troubleshooting system. all necessary information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam site, visit homepage to find news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get to & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to login in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you hit & digikam; for the first time, you'll be asked where to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data sequence is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later, you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will also use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the pictures, as a base folder. & digikam; look at each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during search of the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; needs to recursively exclude the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude subfolders unless it iste in hidden folders. this lets you insert a point before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not take photos as symbols. you can change them by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam; you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, then & digikam; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">A simple to use camera interface is provided to allow you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums can be downloaded. of course, every medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras, which has been developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port is slow, this connection has become obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and carries the transmission of the pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, thumbnail images may not be seen or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to see & digitized is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam; to provide Kphotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in & digikam; self-perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">The drag and drop of images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaud, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name functions only if it is displayed in the symbol view. what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Albensettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date the album was initially created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album import pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. in order to access the album features, right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. selecting or deleting collections from the toolbar or adding albums to collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by date with view records sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Eldest, Average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to this end, the average of the images is used from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; it should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; Select as album title. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keywordlist left in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can naturally use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be shown in the picture window. each picture is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the associated preview. what information is this, you can change settings digitites; set up. select the albums page and adjust the preview pictures to suit your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help buttons that appear. if you click the mouse pointer to rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such an help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about digitization; goes. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can reach all the functions that were done with & digitised. you can choose between viewing the pictures, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the picture editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Edit... or selecting the right mouse button of the image. in the editing section, you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File menu. to this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs can cause problems with the metadata already contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right-click on the preview and select rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del Falls you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumsliders; organizes your photos on the basis of data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change in the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the data view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags include a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers, which can be assigned individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logical. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My key words'; collapse so that you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The tags are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your tags in other programs. furthermore, the tags are re-imported when the database is lost once & digitization; the images will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keywords, or on an existing keyword, and then select New keywords. if you clicked on a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting from the keywords menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as album title in the pop-up menu. additionally, you can drag the picture to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: as soon as you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My Key & quot; pull and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview pictures and choose from the keywords menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of keywords assigned to it. this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will be displayed in the main window preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the right-click context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu only displays the tags that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a select box can be moved over this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower right of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Here you find all reviews of the last months over to root and to discover.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you will save a simple search box like the one described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search is performed. the results will be displayed in the View My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your search request again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the search form appears again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog box appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select to delete the search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules are listed in line with search group / search group. an option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., Keine... or At least... At least you can search the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar. by means of a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can drag in or out with the mouse wheel. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this presupposes your images Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lightbox in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem light table from the contextual menu. the selection will be added to the Lighthouse and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the thumbnail panel you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. when you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the left-hand side. this simplifies to work through a number of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal fire-fighting actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the image, you must click on it and hold the & LMB; hold in the mode preview then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. just use the zoom-knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zooming out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory administration - apart from the buzzword? digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos creates a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes on, indexed, categorised, assures, seeks, transforms, confectures, and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data that provides information about or documenting other data that are administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you can find more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no inventory management to find a particular photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then use certainly not & digikam;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and a secure archiving, which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you interfere with your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger disk.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your data. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend using the metadata option to save metadata in & digikam, which ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change some? added & digikam; to them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign any photo keywords, labels and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, key words, as you often say in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogue pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one subtree to another. the modified keywords are followed by & digikam; refreshed while it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let your photos be seen simply, they want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you consider it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachute; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides a spellchecker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographical data. & digikam; can also export kml files that can be opened with GoogleMaps. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights in order to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digikam: should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support neither commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): linked to the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this may be titles like: hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that offers the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, here the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the picture. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each picture. & digikam; will be available in the near future such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifespan, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious topics must be treated and you may not be trusted more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in stock quality that last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion space.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not available for Macs yet. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Please read the media with a description, date & author and then store it in a clean, dark, dry and protected environment. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskbuilders keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's manufacturers include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: disks are the longest if you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperarisations, the error rate increases dramatically. some of SMART errors are the most common cause of failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices make electric shocks not much, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed sensors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage, hardware switch, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and removes the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this ensures a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage spurs that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a multitude of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even an failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and order the system to run down. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in electricity interference with the cost avoidance of this. a high quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desaster-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undiscovered until you one day to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at present, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of mistakes a year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle sheet errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrs file system. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data in the notebook and 46% on the workstation systems. notebooks are already 50% for notebooks.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash suggests you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget aviation space: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is why Desaster Prevention always means not local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup has been changed. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike scripts-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, sync only the difference of the files that have really been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original kept, memory, scalability, media, recovering images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the ability to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & Dollar, the new record is / dev / sdc & Dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of the reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromativisas data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there is relative a lot of administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images of high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open format format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the TIFF / EP format and obliges to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block "; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a blend of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there can be problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI workshops, standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera editor, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures with & digikam, then you should add the metadata again. it may be cut off from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, code in MPEG, use contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the Adding a Photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digitize your digital camera, connect it to your computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a completed indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not provide preview images. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider Metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the & digikam window; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all the photos from your camera into a single album in & digikam;. downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired by using the default selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. the selected button is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digikam. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download all the buttons, a dialogue with which you can select the destination album will appear in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed, as normal folder is sorted. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, then you have to select them first and then delete selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos were downloaded successfully into a & digikam; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually re-utilized after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames, if you load photos from different recording studios to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image was made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option Date & Time. for more adaptations you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digikam, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in preview. your settings to rename are saved and used automatically if you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam, use this to automatically load subalbums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & digikam, the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced tab and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. then select upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog appears for the camera. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position specified in length and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click, which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitize; users want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailites and map references. so the question is actually more how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to geographical attribution (manual) and finally through manual entry of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a couple working with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that uses the ExercTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the callsign-hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over his workflow as possible. there are many settings that change behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you need to set up the Settings menu. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing, so that you set the default behavior of & digikam; note, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected from the camera interface when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be names such as hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. by doing so, it is reached that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digikam, without going to be lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image descriptions as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the descriptions embedded in the pictures. this allows your labels to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; tries to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; albumfolders that have none of these extensions, by & digikam; ignored.</seg>

<seg id="293">You can set the default values on this page. however, some images have different sizes and synchronous mode is then not available. however, some images have different sizes and synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size ladyquot; you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are set here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not decrease image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for training and unpacking. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF option, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality because the Deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present, it develops very quickly into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights. use the setting of passing white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results because it displays the pointed lights in various pink tones. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the shrews to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a matter how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it a bit higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the digital image options. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data, which comes from the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which is a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for color softening correction as you are done during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a colour space in the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions If a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files will start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder can be found here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all of your profiles. & digikam; examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard source; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't fix for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will be loaded by & digikam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks that are carried out by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left-hand side. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring them to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitize; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can manually set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving from &gt; pictures in the trash bin, you can adjust the discussion of & digitization; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find further details in the deletion of a photo and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & digitising, if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without using any backward queries. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen of & digikam; at startup it speeds up & digikam the start process;.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digikam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by clicking and selecting the entry / editing item.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the Image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original picture before using File Save or Save the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with file storage.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or button Restore the Image Processing button in the toolbar. you lose every change you've done on the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by modifying or restoring Edit back or restoring Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and restart Ctrl; switching to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, click on the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a contextual menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, down image or using the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the Ansichts menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: zoom magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode. you get to the normal view where you can use the Esc key. normally, the tool bar will be displayed. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Settings dialog by & digikam; change it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire sets. entire image preview images can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu album Exporter Print Assist. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again to the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can type or insert labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. this allows you to read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sortation. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in gency in the IPTC field. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this & digitisation; -session applied keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The Keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when entering keyword in a picture series. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed by marking the relevant check boxes in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their Album, - date, keyword and search results is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right Keyword tree was drawn to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place every time the program starts. it can also be switched between different settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created, and notice that it needs to be one or its, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work. additionally, you should make sure to make links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should I use another color space and think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibriate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibriate your monitor as sRGB depends on your monitor. if you are working as the sRGB colour gamut, you need to callibriate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, align, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Correction Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values across the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its colour shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Equilibrate: this method adjusts the luminous function of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. it sometimes produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in one image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new jiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted as a colour space is working with 8-bit per color. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original picture and the preview of the target image. the preview will be adapted dynamically to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original image again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">A histogram is shown to the right of the picture that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is shown in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make this happen. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour-mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instruction for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter Color Administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to store your settings so that you can use it for more photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner will always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the gradation tool that allows you to find gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam utility color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was a result of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the ionization. at approximately 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment finally produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquire; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a projected colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediagot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light at the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can experiment with the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse issue: a too big saturation. in this case too, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / gamma, the tool is setting sound value correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you only need the scope of the slide. more concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slides are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use the control is to shift the controller and to take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side you can see the original and preview of the image. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left hand side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often the most useful. if images contain large areas of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic arrangement is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gammasts.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinched pettes can be used in preview of the original picture to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to adjust the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and recharged later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, medium and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values to the red, green and blue channels of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, linear mode is most useful. in this case, linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a part section to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp Curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the vertices of the curve for all channels of shade, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you find overexposed pixels in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that has been corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another sophisticated tool to mix the hues of the images. you can edit it from the Edit menu color mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are on the right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminanz the image will retain the overall brightness as well, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the disclaimer. it consists of small noise files that do not appear at the same location in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different. if this is the case you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can store any mixer setting for later and then load it. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the option Luminanz stays activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction ability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as ink pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">SLEaton: creates warm light and medium tones as it adds a little cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and redevelopment in a squieter. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sutafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digikam; use tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, no matter if it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: use this parameter to set the desired frame type for your image. completely surrounded the picture with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of the frame in percent. the width of the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image which is decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before cutting.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any point. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text item, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need it. the larger the image, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you chose for your text can be changed until you press OK. after the image has been saved once, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digikam; apply mould template you can put a template across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The picture template menu apply in image processing can be used to lay stencils on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digikam file, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view mirrors the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder updates the preview toolbar automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Reduce: this knob reduces the image below. it is centered around the mouse position. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically adjust the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Sharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it doesn't sharpen any bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing may be the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is the result of the digitalisation process colours with minimal differences to one color point. this in turn leads to sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter already while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call this by the menu entry Correction Catching.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this however carefully because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but enhances also the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. under refocussing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to make soft characters with the menu entry Corrigieren soft draw and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and impression of grenades will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference-amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined with it to be applied for an edge of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and hence beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocussing refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted unfold filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to sharpen an image & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a sharpness mask. refocussing achieves usually better results than unsharp mask. you can start it from the menu by invoking colors refocussing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß 'sche Faltung. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred but should pay attention to receiving slips.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß 'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß' is. this is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should make this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrices Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrices size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, eg. JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, missharp masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by using the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for Archiving in Digital Images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing knob sets the sharpness of the area darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most developed tools to remove undesirable artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine tune the filter settings, you can use tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should preserve details so that no sharpness is necessary afterwards. please note that the detail keeping should always be subordinated to directional dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. so set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step size since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, there should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more in quality you receive by choosing this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make this happen. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photograph taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefact in the background that caused by a bad movie placement during the journey. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mock acute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel spacing of the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubrication will occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot remove the entire noise or noise peaks. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more pronounced, but it also adds the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjusting of phase shock absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to make soft characters with the menu entry Corrigieren soft draw and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; Photo Restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film baskets, scratches, compression artefacts and local defects that occur in digital, original, or later digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce compression: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm it produces some compression & quot; artifact quot; - small standards that are to be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make this happen. any adjustment of photo restore can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo Restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film körút on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright pixel & quot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the preview preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbour pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotspot correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead & quot; vignettieringquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many centre filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed, which is impossible to keep the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also use center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise impair effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and colour or grey scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying a equivalent transformation to a raw screen made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correcting applies the transformation with a crank filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">You can control the vignite correction filter with three regulators and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-strengthening attenuation at the point of the largest density of the filter. standard density is 2.0, resulting in an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, resulting in compensating the density around a larger degree of vignetting, reducing it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correcting of the vignette correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree measures the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar rounding effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grades corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. negative values can be corrected tonal distortion and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameter has the inverted character of the Parameters General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and results in correction of first graft. increase negative values while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne and cushion-like correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. in the best way, you perform this correction as the first one. if you reap a picture and then perform a tonne-like correction, the effect is evidently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best corrections, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it with the cutting tool in the menu Transformable cropping out of the image processing or the Zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs like shots from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonne-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can see the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters to adjust film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Adding film granulator if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows will white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter blends color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infra-red filter design applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film granulation is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film granulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image receives a timeless ambiance from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy looking especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film licensing effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensibility corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">Der & digikam; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Der & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a cabbage. the lines that define the outlines in drawing are emphasized. images of their gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved by adapting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Der & digikam; Filter Gravur shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">Der & digikam; Filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equal to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: similar to the wave-blocks 1, the image here is distorted by another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom uncertainty: blurs the image along star-shaped lines starting from a center point. this simulates the blur a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurs the image by turning the pixel around a center point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: taking photos from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurred blur: blurs the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Vibrating blur: blurs the image by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreate it through the colt with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives you natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digikam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by mirroring or turning in the right direction. the tools for this purpose can be found in the Transformer menu of Turning or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transforming size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase the image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blowing was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the Rider New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. to increase any photo size can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Stop button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not just a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a picture you just need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save menu in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the range for cutting to the highest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio, its settings will save depending on image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the matching help allow help to fade in, so that you can put your images together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-party gel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mid: the golden centre is a division that has different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid relief lines when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos to achieve. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results in the viewer's gaze along the spiral line and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">One more rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is directing at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to place a static object can be released more dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your picture focus on one of the angles and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontally reflect and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image processing and tool free rotation repair. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right side of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. but notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a point of reference to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be recharged. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image will be a little lubricated. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get irresistible triangular holes at the corners. a way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal loop, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate horizontal and vertical at the same time. when you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect is displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are blended. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is blurred a bit. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two drafts produce twice as much interruption and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the image has triangular holes in the corners. a way to eliminate these is to cut the picture with transformer cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; only shows files in formats that know. this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in the image processing will change. you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; accept change. in the Configuration section, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw picture format, you can read in English on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw picture converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section, you will find further information about using modules with & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading raw images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digikam. with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coffin's web page.</seg>

<seg id="701">All picture editing tools such as sharpness, molluscs, noise reduction, refocus, imsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applied quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper section shows the original and the lower in comparison to the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over 'style: shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under exposure. the used colors can be adjusted in the general setup page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and place it on the part of the image you want to see. preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values. all the settings of the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar properties show the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data come from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can drag in or out with the mouse wheel. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this presupposes your images Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes that are installed by & kde can apply either to the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your Personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user-defined color and finally used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Dialogue Palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that contain & graphviz are outdated and X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphviz; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphviz; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & Pounds; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & Placards; recomputes the graph and represents in & kgraphics viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or graph in & calliviewer; in a & Placement; -component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knot and a hack to represent more than this knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for displaying the graph. needs are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the ph is to be recharged or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Settings kgraphiviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a Graphite file outside a running & clowviewer; -instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kgraphviewer; instance or want to display the graph in a subwindow of the currently running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to one side are to be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph divided on several pages without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The renewal site gives the option of setting the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the option to specify the behavior of & kgrapher; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The site administration page gives the option to specify the start behaviour of & kgraphiviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or do not) or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, usually displayed with one click in the main window with the & RMBs, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graph. it produces representations in accordance with the sprung model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a springboard model for ungerized graphene. it uses the Fructman pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-lattice trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm subordinates the nodes circular to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for nonlit graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scanning pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this to work you have to install Kooka and Sane.</seg>
<seg id="775">If you open the menu entry pictures appear a dialog that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by displaying the default default values of your own to select your image. see the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image with the Scan button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scan button, you need to wait for the scan to be completed and the window will appear to specify the image file's options. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files. you must also select the Folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>

<seg id="797">The Exporter module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are led through the process of creating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can sign up at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send pictures to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented to you following a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will see the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Exporter module is run to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which welcomes the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add button should be pressed once you have set all the other options. this button allows you to select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you click on the Ok button, you can upload photos to Flickr Server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed on a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to manage a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data that were included in the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be recalculated with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation setting gives a top deviation for the GPS time and camera distance. if the deviation below will be merged, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have any suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and enlarge the sie.Fuel it over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be switched between Card Mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages up to 4.01. you can select the albums that want to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded to UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tab in which the settings can be adapted. the tab allows you to select all albums that want to be exported to HTML. you need to select these albums only. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kudexshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab Album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other Color Depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. therefore, you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will be started automatically at the end to view the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mausing. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed as default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loser-free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as no compression of color information takes place. this can be found, for example, at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailing list @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you have clicked on the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in form of slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTool and ImageMagick. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that are to be packed into MPEG Diaschau. after that, you can start creating the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the picture transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set up next. in doubt, you should let it black. you can set the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file. keep as close as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it is integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie by coding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a coffee quickly or in all peace and enjoy the slide show if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTool and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in mode for a single image. with the thumbnail, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as Gamma, Brightness and Red / Blue Amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. use this mode if you are sure, for example by testing on a single image that is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image will be selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non Proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size, and background color, will be adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the picture window is displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The button pictures remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not take care of sending too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images will be attached to a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Picture File format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original-export data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status notifications, on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant transitions by OpenGL. however, you have to have an appropriate graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it using Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The images randomly choose ensures that the images are displayed in a random order, so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends, however, on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. at random, every transition between the images elects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI team mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with comments, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in every group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press persons with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown. through this selection method you can limit the number of shown images of a few thousand images to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save their own thumbnail, this is of course also valid for locations, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the name, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the upcoming context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the picture-view window (described in more detail) and display the item-editor in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. you can view this dialog in the picture once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the Description field or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date that will be searched; the date can be either a part of the total date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots, and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum, see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the shown entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture will display this date in preview preview) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select a range, only pictures of this time frame are displayed in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; the one is available in & kphotoalbum; the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. you will find information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are exported from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download any images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a bigger picture, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages are created. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, right, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The above settings have all three on base folder or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time looking at the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kin file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact that the images themselves are stored in the file, or if there is only one connection to images in the file. the advantage to save all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can share this file as independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file looks for the images in two ways. first, it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .kin file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the manual, you have to copy the images to the .kim-file in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & kphotoalbum with the Automatically option to the .kim file; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the option Export File.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kin file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, will & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folders the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons to the imported file (if you are a domain) while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the imported file to the categories of your current database. you can see an example of this on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, via (2) searching and viewing up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your images, but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re-use it in future starts. if you want to read a different folder tree with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can access the preview settings and the options for the viewer. a detailed help is available for each setting, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define various properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to process existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete member groups, i.e., all members of a group at one time in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but they are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are used together with each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should always test new modules with the demo database before applying them to your own images The & kphotoalbum; demo database can either be accessed via the command line using the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates for some modules the order of albums so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all the pictures showing you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum has to be released; the modules also include a list of albums. here's a & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people for example, & kphotoalbum; do so, so whether you would have chosen persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and a toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you can see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but first click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all images Jesper is shown and all images were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the pictures within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, therefore, that the names used are moved up to find and classify people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have annotated notes for each image separately, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the ones before and back buttons that are under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window displaying the USA as an over-group. to show you that it is an overboard, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to select this entry into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a box by moving it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which offers you, among other things, the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and then hide / hide the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and select either the delete button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now the window will appear you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can also use images to record images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now to ask for the insertion of the CD. if so, if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the picture menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that at the end those left you want to make for others and click the Current View menu in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister can see, control and unlock the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to determine which pictures should be hidden in case of a case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply tick the menu entry pictures, so that all the images you have blocked will be hidden. if you want to display the images again, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select the password in the Privacy Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture-protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other hand can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to withstand the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have downloaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture up and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be accessed from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. started and stopped the slide show through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">Use the Minus button to zoom into the center of the image and zoomt in the center of the image, showing how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">The point button allows you to reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the Frequency button sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can annotate the current image using the menu item Notices from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can open the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to just mark the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with characteristics as you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this picture you can see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have added features to your images, they are available in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, just tag all at once with annotations. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do right now.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in thumbnail. when you view categories in the thumbnail view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to use & kphotoalbum; paint it on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to enable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; to switch on, select On the picture from the contextual menu. to exit the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but you should have read and understood the documentation to & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire-model views are shown yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the sub-object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the Edit menu bar, or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered attributes, click Apply to take over these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera's control points. you can drag them with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a stage of view as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object, or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when selected, or their stage of view is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below an existing view, pull the tap to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle shows then the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the tap to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of that view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on each other, drag the tap into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tracker at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, pull the tap on the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing to the left in the summary bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the summary bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window arrangement... save it. there will be a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them renders. & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering symbol Rendering the toolbar or select View Scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes as you want, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render settings menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every render mode has a name. you can enter any name, it makes sense but a name that lets you see the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination, you can select the properties, which & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection lighting. detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">These images often have a Moirè pattern or scale effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling does incorporate the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is distributed over and over again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and examined for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on ittering, changed & Povray; the beams down a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the associated rays did not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly ended, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full range of commands of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene simply tick the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and version here. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the windows type.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross high level of detail for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the window arrangement section, it explains how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window classifications displays all existing window classifications. a new arrangement can be created by adding the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all the views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and hovering the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installs and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, you will see at the first launch of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will have to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the property tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wiremodel view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points that you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button on the user or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert the Finite Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an understandable way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the property tree, change the name and then click the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view now shows the level, even at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the + in front of the object. then you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tab. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button thumbnail to see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, you can preview the pigments only a matt black material, because you still have to make adjustments for the pigment. keep in mind that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header or sphere in the preview, click on the Apply button and then go to the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you change your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors you expected. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the sphere can be just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget the input button or the button apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matted black material. in the following step use a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first sub-object and change the name, for example, in ball pigments. click on the pigment pigment, then choose single-color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not at all selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers you. hopefully, you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful sceneries.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog can impact. thus, the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you created beforehand with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversible command. you can only select this menu item when you have used the Undo Undo button.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Open a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new shortcuts for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodelers.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to create rough surfaces without having to model any hives on the surface individually without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuokshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Using & kuokingshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Configuration - & kuokshow; there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuokact; in the two other, short commands for the display window and shortcuts for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & kuokshow; already the next image in the folder, while you are still looking at the current image. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option save & kuokshow; when moving the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kuokshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & cloak show; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is enabled as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">In order to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field, or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until it is canceled by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcut for the different modes of operation of & kuokshow; in the flashcards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions that mostly also exist in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists, and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed due to a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script does not work.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the script / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts are written to the default input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure allows the script to display the setup dialog. in order to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is being picked up. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example, the metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu item is clicked. in order to add an entry to the menu you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminate, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for instance, saving up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2) which can optionally also be compressed using bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the creation of amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permission:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can append it to www.kde-apps.org and follow the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Amarok Category script.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date pieces visible when changing the play, that the playlists window will roll up / unroll to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of various fonts in & Amarok; selecting Custom Fonts will activate the otherwise gray shown section. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. click Select... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selections. if your own colors do not use, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text shown in the OSD. by entering space holders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi-screen environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate further adjustments in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse sub-folders recursively: this causes & Amarok to search for music both the checked and their subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browsers.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you must have installed kdelibs (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedeskostop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and leave the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly it is because Tagliad crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you are using MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email automatically opens at a crash). if this is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta information, but not as a Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another Sink (e.g. Colsink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just as xine.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the features of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your single-click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch from the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display, you can also see the PL and EQ buttons. the PL-button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from Classic to Techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you activate the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist for all & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of features deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area you will find some of the most excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the running piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be more emitter in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow starts off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to look at the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context-browser will also display cover images, which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the Recommended pieces are the favourite pieces from this artist. this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right click somewhere in the subwindow and select from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, the artist's albums, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the running piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the highest level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the performer, and there will be another division after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group artist / year - album - Sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - Albumname is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your tunes will first be sorted by genre and among them by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This attitude works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by an album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Right under the toolbar you find a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you have different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. furthermore, you can of course also select your total collection, thus making the filter virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This gives the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set items in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">For media players, add the pieces to the media player to send them to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - this will broadcast the selected pieces to K3b and burned as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Moving files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - select the selected album as a composition, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Record label selection - Change the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. afterwards, the album is no longer displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The Playlist Browser is easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also includes Smart Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">You can also add created Smart Playlists. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer tracks to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, exit & Amarok; and solve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area where you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a set URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than it is in the window, the holding of files can be difficult by simply dropping files. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist retains all of you to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces containing the letters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two three, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces found that contain one or two or three (or combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then wrap the search term with geese feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR scores: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click the right mouse button in the desired sequence on the entries. the entries will then receive a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left you can find the Add button with which you can add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, push back and restore buttons. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, enlarged analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button. through this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, such as renditions and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for access mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking twice in the respective display area with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist. you can access the settings of & Amarok via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already pre-given (the details of the setup of these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to make this dynamic playlist work.</seg>

<seg id="1458">Save all opened projects. this is the same as if you'd run file storage for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and not saved yet, ask & k3b; after what is to happen. you can then reject between saving and changes. furthermore, you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any project that is not stored, just as if you called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and terminates & k3b;. for each unsaved project it is asked what is to happen, as if you called File Close.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you visit this entry, you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the so added files will appear in the root folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">This dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make a lot of project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described above the What is this? remedy (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you are using files for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this feature is not used. it is intended for you more than aid so that you can see the files and folders existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows even without a project file copying a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can only create an image of a CD that you can then burn later. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Open the DVD copy dialog. this allows even without a project file the copy of a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. converting / comminating a DVD with the help of copying is not yet supported so the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the total (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. this dialog allows you to format a DVD + R (W) so the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modi overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burning a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be fired instantaneously by pressing the burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you must use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burning a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired instantly by pressing the pressing button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting of black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is shown in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is enabled, a small bar will be displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not enabled, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The top bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view includes open projects. the top bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; After selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard layout below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows the correct authorizations to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; general program settings can be made here. almost all functions of & k3b should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalisation and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the dcop command line program, you can use either the dcop command line program or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the accompanying programs will give you preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void BootCdrv () void executCdrv () void BurnCdImage () void BurnCdImage (KURL url) void BurnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can obtain a project via the command line: # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString English) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, QString The parent) void removeItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString Name) void setVolumeID (QString Name) void setVolumeID</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createData CDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createData / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio creator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoding (compressed) files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (these encoder packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per caption) compress into the MP3- or OGG format or also to other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all of these programs are already available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the encoder packages must be installed that are needed. for example, if FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? Welcher Kodierer's chapter gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudio creator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device handles the protection, it is not possible to avoid copy protection. simply avoid buying a copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained later. this will (hopefully) lead to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, all of which is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step, for example, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tabs. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the code settings tab in the setup view - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the standard. it must be noted that before the encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already loaded file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, piepses) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides flac there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage over mp3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high audio quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= this setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= this setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all songs of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio creator; parameters that can be used (= button identifier in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of entering the machine. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this kind of configuration, so it appears, the email address will not be used when retrieving data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has verified the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more about it, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read-only wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoder's tab. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package needs to be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodiers can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and write real on it, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) will be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 stitches (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write permission on it (eg; try to copy something into it using the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audio creator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what each issuing & CD; must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them with every read on a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device identifier can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of the device labels for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map of General Settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left as left / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information will be selected, so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data can be downloaded automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; record found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how do the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load will be distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since many firewalls boxed the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore just try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard the last piece: tick this to the & CD; throw it out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if only place on another drive is present. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All this is done in the same way as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, and under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent id3 'Tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of concurrent wav files at the same time: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than one wav file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & audio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will build a connection to the internet as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb want to pick up. the process described in this section must be repeated for each issuing & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; use that is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from those for a & CD; with success obtained from freedb data. hence, you will learn the & CD; data manually entered instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD; in the drive that has been defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then look for questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually invoke this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first row of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all songs of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only be satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. all words with capital letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator. this option is set up on the coding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the issuing CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks selected are read out. a simple click on the row switches on the selection of the piece. just make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking the button Select the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the entries and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You see this error message when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here for example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files folder and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the MP3 format. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in performance-weak machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (but of two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & audio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; will talk today within the & kde; CVS as part of the kdemultimedia package. if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, since & kde multimedia files. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons compiled by source files, not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that many different programs call up has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still am reading? even if only the Help menu has been clicked after the first launch of the program, without any indication as to continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? whoever reads this has probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a handbook to & kaudiocreator; it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; at least only after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have managed to get the source file from the & kde; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke game of & kde; besides others it has with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time representation of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project Driver, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -windows can drag to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically calculates the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button play in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid, play a piece, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and running with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo indicator and thus change the playing speed. in order to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, so interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which one song is used, so that you don't have to manually set it manually. so if you select an automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the Karaoke text will be selected automatically. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select menu items or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played after the series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu Collection below the point Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then adding the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired object in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When applying the application, this collection is not saved. remember, if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the Add button. it appears in turn to the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatic add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the sub-menu selection sequence of the main menu, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the next song button, the next song from the menu item, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the previous piece, the previous piece from the menu item, or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of type change to Bright Piano into events of the change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets a trumpet sound when it was originally supposed to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM-compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "The name of the keymap"... END Define keymap "Another keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as email so that I can provide in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how General MIDI's patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Note that the left side of the parity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional all KeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do so, you can add the following to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term "drum patch" the patch is meant, in which each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, tank, maracas, etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to map sounds on the percussions channel. for example, take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name name for this channel is needed. if you use the keymap option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which gets a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a ton higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboard (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; it contains the same MIDI file on two different devices to produce very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable setting automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default speed, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open on a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to do programming, collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge joy when you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you send me a postcard or MIDI file, I will be among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid, completely written in my spare time and didn't get any money for it. I would like to stress that I will only continue programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - solving the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke-files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffwmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback will start with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', television and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, choose from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlists from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and end can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will keep the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a startup animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; smilgt; & lt; body.; & lt; img dur = "file: / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / & lt; / body.src = "meet," supported by SMIL, supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; you can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To enable the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer module must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments from KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to run in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this needs to be done by changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the device to use and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer is to use the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be identified ports from which one is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnavsprsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introl, pipesource, tvanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they begin playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is to run as user root after the device is connected. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why must my CPU be checked for its performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is obsolete. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1741">Qt;: & Qt; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support, and is used to compile & box;</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems, it is probable to use the package & textual; and / tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are contained on the box; web page.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde; & & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly need to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the box should be established.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If questions arise or when compiling & kicking; on or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed on the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; Desktop. & Kile; offers the opportunity to use all & latex; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, & Kile; the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & Posters; and to experience its possibilities, the handbook to Kate should be drawn. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & posters.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a Lay (engl.lay) & latex; macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While only a good overview of & latex is given, it is not the ultimate book. to be able to master correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As well as other markup languages, & latex; an introduction with which the most general features such as paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ documents {document} and must be closed again using the command\\ begin {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this allows the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], book [Report], Articles (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], slides [prosper], or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this sets the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 coding as default. at best, UTF-8X should be known (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), Review (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is only a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source code editors - the emphasis of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & Kile; it is highly probable that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is highly probable by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it is spared you by highlighting time and utility.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the settings, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically creates an empty line (for the input of the text) and the associated line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI file. as soon as a DVI; file [device independent file]] has been created], & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the official output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the code search, the items of the DVI; file are connected to the editor and as soon as an item has been clicked on in the DVI; file is bounded to the corresponding section in the & latex; source search is the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text has been clicked, the corresponding place is jumped in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be selected for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "file surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is" "" "warmed" "" "on the ndere.â and there is no call from & eyepiece; after fast construction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be displayed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of joint elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -orders for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">"" "the selection box" "" "More" "" "is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the options available are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection via a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex, this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex, corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & boxes; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for determining the font size. you can specify the font profiles for the main text, the reference notes, etc. there are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting up the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] defines the fonts. if the font names are not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code needs to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is using the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the push button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & box; stores the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document compiles, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if fast construction should be used & eyepiece, it should also be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging of the document should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (engl. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with lettering is created and only a few columns should have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are reported only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for obtaining the readability and ease of user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either using the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is available until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be recursively presented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Following the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few passages in fat and italics, and a poem will be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device-independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like Printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of a document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. to do this, only Modern under Settings box needs to set up... Tools Buildings can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for pre-search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on forward search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer is then executed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this & box; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece; set as text editor... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you don't open a quick installation of the & DVI file, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be summarized in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file records the source of errors in the source code. in the editor you can use the launcher LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line where the error appears. in order to view the faulty line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & box; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">If you choose empty document, you can either rewrite a document from scratch or use the wizard to create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings box... Settings General can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and you will be bored through the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& box; used & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and exiting from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for posters; can be made in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters; and to learn about its possibilities, the manual about Kate should be drawn. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be accessed via LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word meaning that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ authentication only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with a printed left mouse button, the selected text will automatically be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search and highlight different kinds of source texts. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can enter into additional jump marks. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the MenÃ ¤der editing hocks or the corresponding keypad mean the jump to the next or last jump stamp. this also highlights this jump stamp, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile;. although & Posters; already excellent possibilities offered, in & box; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is added. & latex; special commands for their selection. under Edit Selection, the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bending problem in & box; is that the files are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning since this command is also available & latex; -commands with a hot spread (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document it can be washed first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description of Editing Parts.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; that's why & Kile offers; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible straightforward work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to protect the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, sprays will be sprayed to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups which are intended by brackets {...}. under the Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the grazing bracket of a & tex; group #, the group will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups clamps, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference signs are used as GÃ ¤nsesprouts. for the beneficial implementation is used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple reference signs. also for ending the application the character is used. & Kile; knows this case and add two other signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double callsign can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; input button for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, t & Kile closes; the current line with\\\\ with a complete newline break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings box; LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users would like to classify the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & box; after the next tab in the above line. although this tab does not belong to the associated line, & Kile; some space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already providing a good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; for special commands (usually for & latex;). there are three different modes available. all these modes can be configured for different working methods under Settings box... completely set-up.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the\\ end {Environment} command after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the key is pressed, the last letter of the input is removed and, unfortunately, the mailing list is deteriorating. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be incorporated into these positions, so that an easy jump to these positions can be made possible by using jump marks NÃ ¤chste bounce mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; All settings can be made to these lists. you can select different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; -orders as well as dictionary of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for completion of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call of full-state mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are so often used that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-length mode over the menu-editing environment or the key-key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin. after that, the ambient compaction can be continued in the simplest way and can be terminated by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... boxes; All settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rter list of the full-length mode for & tex; - and & latex; -orders.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support user-defined lists of cancellations that are immediately replaced by a more expensive string. lists can be set up under Settings box... Kile can be set up completely. for example, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word substituting over the menu with full length or key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the character L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large-scale books are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been ascertained that many people in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile offers; the full-length compensation for all required devices.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Kile can be disabled completely. here, the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the full length.</seg>

<seg id="1854">To examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all tools are grouped in groups in the compilation compilation, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key-key Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, ladet, have a lot to do with & quantaplus. by this the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a Kpart, we start with the menu plugins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus, this path for searching the plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus, supports the statement of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and serves to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member may have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking at the team member from the list and press the button 'Set' button. the currently selected member (their identities) will appear fat after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and the setting of one's own identity are important in regards to messages and notes. see further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to be made to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An e-mail is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Insert notes is simple. either the note entry from the Editor context menu can be selected or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the name of the assigned top name of the team member, role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader After the area and subproject ladders, the respective area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around brackets and: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus, is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus, -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus, concerning tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Attributes are case-sensitive: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase means that the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, will be inserted for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags, except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish date automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic insertion of accent notes: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimic types for the detection of different types of files. using the Default button, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus, creates regular backup copies so that during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a map), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings back to the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and other / depending on the views. it corresponds to the --resetting layout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area serves to control the display of warnings by checking no more requests.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchronization behavior of the VPL and source text view in shared mode. regarding the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of structure tree adjustments the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those with which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The range for setting shortcuts (a type of templates), which can be unfolded when editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are in groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause is something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed by plug-ins. plug-ins are third-party applications, which can be re-used by any part-capable application, the most known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-ins, the following should be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located in a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be delivered to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load the component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only-read-kparts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus, whether the entered information is correct. then, select the input if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implementations about plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger plug-in drop-down selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus, user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is requested, the execution will begin as soon as a request is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next statement in the script without entering into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible incorrectly in functions and include errors.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Assign the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front-end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how to help & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus, to provide support for market and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility make from & quantaplus, a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic lists of image buttons (above the editing window), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialoges, the & quantaplus, for the tag. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick inserting of tags into a document without the risk of a writing mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tag XML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible for other users to have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute, etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code for the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to reach the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groupes the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">This tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything, but look at & and lt; Notes. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any fracture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog top in & Quantaplus is to start and check tagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; -Schema. the filename for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, reachable via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc can be edited; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Reverse 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... click New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keypad assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keine the current keypad can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus, even are the quick start dialog, or the different view in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptxt / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There is another special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID from the current & quantaplus, process. if by & quantaplus, only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus, from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can input from & quantaplus, to the default input. in the drop-down field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be rerouted. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value to the Output box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to create tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to specify actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable "Edit Day" dialog when available, so that an input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Show other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select the size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol will insert & lt; start; tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions to specify... (in & quantaplus,) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Applicant button and continue with other tags as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus, add functions to toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar to adjust dialog via settings toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by bending all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your descriptionrc; so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, the second we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2, func1, tag2, tag3 func1 = function1.html tag2 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, look now in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is directly referenced to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus, resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to design context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you stated in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth dividing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus, community. they will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or anyone else. in various places, there is an email-sent menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP), sending the toolbar with email, in the contextual menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archives, from where all other & quantaplus works; the contributions will be checked and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a cabbage contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled in (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, upload tool bars toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signification. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus, after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain exactly these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are only available within a certain project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emodes the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus, -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the building views, the card reader with information and the toolbars. please strike in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarker or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer, help for word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the string is referred to as a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a single tag, such as & lt; insert into their document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. now they can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill out different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate, open and roam in the information about & quantaplus. in the presentation with tab cards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes, and documentation building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool providing & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right-click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it is possible to change attributes and namespaces. the application system geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, from the quantaplus, 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & Quantaplus, scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus, toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus, is the ability to send a toolbar by email. & Quantaplus, send the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus, files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus, optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus, now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus, for this, be the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus, as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus, following, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; afforded to users and developers, & quantaplus, as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus, allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible. through the program Commander, they can increase productivity without having to memorize any scripting language syntax. (more on this they will find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has been rapidly expanded into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the details are help: / Quanta (either type this URL in & konqueror, or execute helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A fast-access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; enrolment, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from clipboard into & URL; enrollment, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost for inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Training and enrollment of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the cursor's position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu based on the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Open an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus, -projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manages the project. in chapter & quantaplus, -projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved through settings actions... and you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus, team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows you to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus, own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. smart insert means that & quantaplus, inserting by toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above menu items. click on it. click on an activated plugins deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of newline identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, changeover sometimes takes time or may cause unnice graphics. recommended is the tab mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains one entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, there are details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in the context of the mouse-pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled up from top to bottom, as for example after completing the project name, the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can later be selected using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus, project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemp.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. PHP;, Python, etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"" "if a project is started from scratch, not" "" "hooks" "", "if a project is started from scratch." ""</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">High-load profiles (see in) can be set in the subwindow profiles (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking on its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-defined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus, closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus, changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behaves as well, but the entries open and open with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unreliable password on the disk do not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog box if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. usually this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, that is, by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project toolbar in the project or the project toolbar, accessible via the Toolbars project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are stackable by the menu toolbars. usage and addition differ. adding tool bars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, it can remove other actions such as toolbars, rename tool bars, or adjust tool bars, which can be displayed, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action machined that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and setting actions to set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus, uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus, about the constraints one imagines for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to usage.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. for more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents will be created in appropriate subfolders. you can easily find some examples in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, condensed in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template Save As local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check out the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be drawn simply by dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: just copy the file to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop, or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files tree view to a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-type headers and footers or link dynamically using & PHP; create, insert files or link them to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / templates / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the contextual menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as the sightly attribute is inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except for the root folders in the template. if a root folder is set to default, it would disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to complete a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers by copying content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second splits the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is running synchronously. pressing F9 will activate this mode, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from a window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is configurable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keyword keywords on the name and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS Style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strange. the mark works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the touch button or the distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be made in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags will not remove already existing identical tags, i.e. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other forging anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table wizard or the Listen-Assistent are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed clearly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but exist in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 2 folder folder kdiff3 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows for manually typing file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog shows your selection and shows it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C however a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When combined, the input field is active for target and can be processed. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before starting / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you need to create two corresponding files, download them in & kdiff3, then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text in a comparative window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color which differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows. when the line breaks is activated, the line is scored on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative windows) has also an info line with the header output:, the filename and [Gear] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference at the same time is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes due to automatic merging or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the queue is displayed. this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, when you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the options or Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, side, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the release window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. by inserting the button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the section together and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigating with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Away / Ctrl image Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). there is also the option selection automatically copied. if this is enabled, whatever you select, automatically copies to the clipboard and eliminating the manual copying. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use the\\ r\\ r\\ r\ 'newline. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored to the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When activating this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be astened. on these systems, the Preferences button will automatically display an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of whitespace will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be copied to the clipboard automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which newline type you prefer to save. pre-set value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Comparing files tries & kdiff3; first, to find all fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step will not ignore each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only save a line feed '\', but then files with different sizes in the page-on-side comparison look identical even though they are different. when this option is checked, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping ahead to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatically Selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge. see for details on documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to stop & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for encoding a short note appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16 bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress uplifting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded transition column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to normal even a second check column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply shutdown the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Allocates the comparison windows side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. current file merge in the merge menu also works when you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be passed to this external command first. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs. you can use this function for example to remove annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be passed to this external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line counting to convert your input into capital letters: SED's /\\\\\\ 1 / 'This. * is a regressive expression that matches all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the substitution string moves to the found text in the first clip pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to create automatically generated text strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword substitution.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line retrieval. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to do several executions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Replacement / SCHALTER'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-off algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively using & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and display the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... directs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, used & kdiff3; Folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see further details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to fold out all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical, if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirnff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified, and if the option directories synchronize is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure), then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and hits the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, merging the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, one file is processed after another. it status column shows skill when the merge was successful, and correspondingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will show further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C is used as the target, B is chosen as the target for two-folder merge, and B and / or B will be used as the target for synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check afterwards whether all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries might be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the menu or press F7 (shortcut key). in order to merge only the current entry, select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merge-actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Buttons, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without making the really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, restart / continue directory merge / resume or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; encounters an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you attempt to skip the cause of the problem. thus, you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not be merged again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set specific with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a preceded points. a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: if the option is off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the links will be compared to normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changeset and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal. that can be useful when copying the changeset date. please use caution. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also, the results from merging files are saved in both folders. this option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are any differences, instead of merging the copy of the new file will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and received extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just merging entire folders. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible at the merge of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the option directory & text windows to switch off main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text box.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to run the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparenz using KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders for opening, located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes via the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifiers date. therefore, the permissions or the modifying date deviate from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible in local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDef3Part display from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; to that the input file is a patch file in the unified format. then & kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select View in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or would like to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. by default, configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines, next to each other, this will be more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to easily solve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text you should use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">No src has been removed after the text is removed; no src has been clicked, and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use a different editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDE on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the Folder Folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report it to the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently also not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you have to re-read the folder with the feature refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied when merging is not copied to the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini-preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, finish them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries to set up... and end. however, if an application is clicked within & Kpager, the context menu will also appear as well as the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and End. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximises the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is checked, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is enabled, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">This field leaves the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual workspaces. if it is clicked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty workspaces will be shown to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard icon and pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpagers appear; in a 2xN screen, like from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontal row, which is very well suited for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view and move windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and subsequent selecting the switch... makes the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagesc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi.If you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you need a working installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the picture shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag increases the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can indicate a selected screen area in the magnification window (dropdown mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are using the & Shift key, press the button or the & MMB; move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of features. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click as soon as the mouse pointer holds on the same spot for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, due to the sheer discomfort of the mouse, pain may also be caused. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the pressing of the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. this way you can drag the drag at pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time has to pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligently Move is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before releasing the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse shift. is this function activated, generates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this option is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with presets. in particular, the smart move should be switched off initially. if you then have become accustomed to the automatic click of the mouse, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware at which points a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or at places in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. however, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the wheels. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using an imposition, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can use a mouse click itself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to have a keyboard input. thus, accidental clicking on the mouse button can cause unwanted reactions. safe zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart move when you just start using & kmousetool; use the text instead: hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. as a result, each time & kmousetool; the mouse button depresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when the smart move begins the shooting time begins. later, you can use the smart move without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X windows; this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and they are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling action begins before the mouse button is released. in this way you can also drag and drop with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as to & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character sets replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with pre-defined strings of strings such as: -) by text or for reformatting news from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Transformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard filters set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and the subsequent setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the setting of string replacement filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text. case sensitive is not considered when comparing.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name at any time, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Errors. the list is processed from top to bottom in the order shown.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file that append entries from the file to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is available with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus, the application ID is displayed copy-3432, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Apply filter apply. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\ s word\\ s word. thus, words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; printouts can be called for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the box scuutils package.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these sliders you adjust volume, speech velocity and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and show this gray, the voice you choose doesn't leave these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized more quickly.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the screen reader is read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that sends messages. if you are reading & eg; just read a long text on a web site, you can come with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, inserts & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. moreover, trademarks for controlling the pronunciation of voice and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype SpePUBLIC / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / Deartp: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / ethis.dtd "&gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mom Bär. who slept in my bed? asked the bear.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can be done faster with the preview, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limits detection filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit identifier filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add additional punctuation filter, but it will get off from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select speakers by selecting them. switch on the language selection and enter text to read. check on the card selection, which spokesperson & ktats; select. switch on the speaker selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker changes. naturally, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start reading faster, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">The punctuation filter compare text with a regular expression for set-ups and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab characters are removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit detection filter preserves the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reagents.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the default _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card reader selection, you can overwrite the language settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card card speaker). in other words, no speaking abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate subscriber that has all the features of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select and dictate; the speaker closest to the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the area speaker that is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speakers button and then use speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktats; you probably have to register GStreamer. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, GStreamer may not be installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, it freezes & ktats; one. on the & Console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. please refer to the ALSA project (dmix) on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. as a guide, please send a patch together with the & URL; on which you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program needs to be sox installed and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermodules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML deformation filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & ktats; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file will reject the GENDER tags for converting SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can proceed in & ktts; no more codes in front or back. orders are shown on the trailblasted orders, the job consists only of one sentence. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for punctuation detection.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is already installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts; run the command-register command before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflict in the audio output. if your system is also part of this, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freeze when you stop a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read yet.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setup of the speech speed, but is otherwise not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded & ktats; as tarball (with tar gripped archive), log in as normal user and unzip the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you use it, first check if your speech synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported. in many voices, you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you will find help in the instructions provided with Festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male UK) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software to festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is normally included in the & Linux; distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the option to set encoding to ISO 8859-2 has to be set.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2794">Start kttmsgr. on the flashcard speaker click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and Epos TTS speech synthesizer. if the Epos programs are not in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the map speaker. in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter in a & console; epos -h or say -h to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffen speech synthesizer, written in & Java; i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can adjust neither pitch, volume nor speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module enables you to use & ktts; with any language synthesizer, which can be controlled on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the speech output to a temporary audio file (wav) rather than sending output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf file; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting of network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing & Linux; if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Option network settings at the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. when starting the network settings, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose between the distribution and releasestand best. by selecting the setting non-re-enquiries the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system administrator mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. by clicking the button system management mode, you get to the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, all functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tab:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab Network interfaces serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from tab Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box set up.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatic, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server will not require any further adjustment. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the field netmask, the subnet mask must be defined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on as required. turn on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled, depending on your needs. turn off an enabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS releases its name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed, or modified. entries can be added, removed, or modified. DNS records can be sorted in priority by selecting an entry and drop or downgrading in the list with buttons down or down.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button... It will display the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names in particular describes machine name-to-IP address references to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily at boot when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of known hosts includes some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will support. this still in the review version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click Add. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name-known machine from the list and select Edit... editing the dialogue with your hosts will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediate in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf, is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf / configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assignable to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who uses a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own network, the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary usage is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content as specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file will be re-sorted by scripts in SuSE config. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which furthermore provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; split the band back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. realize & kdat; the pre-spun on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detect & kdat; it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by a change of the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape was resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band card must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not conform to formatting in & kdat. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you get formatted by the tape of & kdat. floppy drives usually do not require formatting of tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, & kdat, continue with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after the formatting process is finished, the tape is automatically included and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you run the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens. in this dialog, you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Once you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkup process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have validated the settings for recovery, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can re-create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">In this way, a backup profile is created with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set up the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed in backup files, only the files on the same filesystem are backed up, such as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is seen from tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file from the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path has to refer to the non-winding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat before the tape is included, the command will load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the throw in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when releasing the tape, the tape is automatically ejected; do not use this option in floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware-supported log size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to communicate & kdat; in any case you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is computer name: seconds, where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have been formatted since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is included.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; features are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the single options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, try & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not display you, and it will open instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably don't have permission to read under Linux in the / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by selected criteria or entered strings. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter contains the entry All. in the default setting, the selection box contains the entry All. then a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. in addition, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so you will see & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more striking color as minutes lines of level note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned on setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to skip to new lines in the main window's context menu to display all new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. where you can find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the Folder & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named so) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly becomes the standard for checking program start-up when the system is run in & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. der & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init file was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysV init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start at boot time or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls go to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the program init in various places and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. if you've got something messed up, then you'll get it repaired by relaunching the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; also, I could also have a user running level, which & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand device is easy to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runways to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new area. in order to merely copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert them into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (available system services, Runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are recovered from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine restarts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services in these distributions are launched simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg. httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that you can add it to this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program lets you manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the Save menu in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two learning flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have limited space restrictions (Quota) for users will create a map on which you can make individual adjustments. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears when shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card will only appear if there is a limited filesystem space restriction (quota) and is initialized (recognizable by the quota user / quota group file on the file system). parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited space restrictions listed in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the file system with a limited space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map group provides information about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group Dialogue features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add from the user group or group, or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add the boot password, remove and change the time to boot from the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
