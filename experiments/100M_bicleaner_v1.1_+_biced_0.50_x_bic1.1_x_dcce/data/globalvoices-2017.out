although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the murder@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like that &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of the mountain as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in multi@@ tudes .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections was the highest number that a candidate who was nominated by the party ever reached .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing human , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung also agreed with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Fein@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp knew his way to nom@@ inees Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( meaning . Ü ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word play from white in allu@@ sions to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like the big Van Jones , has killed just that which America has made so great .
millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America means everyone welcome .
for this country elected as its president , twice the son of an expert , whose history , as he himself says , would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recy@@ cled horn Orchestra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot; &quot; &quot;

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of the An@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments consisting of local solid waste materials is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced by rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tonnes of waste each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset about this and were not inclined to welcome a criminal to this species at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it did not succeed in catching fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are , apart from Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that the Prime Minister had driven out of their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand out mutually where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
by deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstruc@@ ted by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions are happening in real @-@ time , trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . such susp@@ icious driving routes can be detected , such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal .
on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such vessels in their har@@ bours . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
among other things , actions include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , phan@@ tasi@@ es , fishes , protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a land could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not start my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found escape ships .
based on his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international crime against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find crimin@@ ally operating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently Sky@@ Truth co @-@ opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown anywhere in the world using the position of each trac@@ eable ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ra@@ ct criminals but also deter them .
ships that previously had been f@@ ished without a license and had hardly expected to face the consequences are now aware that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover ever since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped Somalia to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa millions of dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined forces with the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia has reported its first great triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship flying under false flag . and not only was the ship travel without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also entered forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal for them to go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is freelance journalist and lives in London .

the street movement in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are seen as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s motion to a referendum on the exercise of office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void , having gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : Venezuela &apos;s reg@@ ression ) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central North located Bun@@ de@@ staat , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ author at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of food and medicine , the referendum on taking office was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( like the round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were united , sum@@ mon@@ ed the trial against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :

on Twitter , pictures , which tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay , centrally located north @-@ north .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government , according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national guards do not have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic shows the round , which covers the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - it was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado argue that 1 % of the signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to keep critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was audi@@ ted on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret maid .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the scale of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power is a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from sports hall to military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
don &apos;t Pass on , that they will not kidn@@ ap you some@@ day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abbrevi@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ERP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party in Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to destroy papers which had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sp@@ ake in , and saw a couch , which men were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just tied there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , shot him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... as a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to the eye .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ded quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you see as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me from ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me about it at home .
next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the reports of survivors , the civilian is Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was a lie - euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boot@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one takes off an enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not war @-@ bri@@ des , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who make a car in the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and shou@@ ted :
if you go so far , I will find you and put you on your own .
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
so my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller collar pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but nevertheless brought clothes back home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the dead is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now that I am older I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the bodies disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ ind and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of viewing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I was repro@@ ached for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked myself why the whole patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed horrible crimes and you forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I granted the first indication .
I had finally realised that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally cancelled against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Def@@ endants were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years imprisonment . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ ances .
eleven of the initially 54 def@@ endants were killed during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ vement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ quote
all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police members and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked on justice for the victims for years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be established there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with translation errors at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend its driving license .

edit the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnessed a very badly mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield the Japanese word was in@@ scribed , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with malicious intent &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ some mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was available from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
revision of the original photograph by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who made the local newspapers aware of it .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed about the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ some &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of altogether 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has declined overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased over the same period .
the re@@ porter , whose name was not mentioned , brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to be opposing older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , who might produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese team , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and enig@@ matic phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints which often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewelry . but from large corporations or from government who have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ ette con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broad@@ caster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped , and advised users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
deals like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of turbul@@ ences .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ gel@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible due to a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests from certain domains .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds incor@@ rectly or refuses the request when calling this website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV was on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet links : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Tina fights for children &apos;s rights and collect testim@@ onies from other crimes that have become the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of cur@@ ative .
the following article is the shortened version of a cur@@ ative report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from university , she returned to the house once more and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she &apos;s like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money out@@ hands her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days in house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a treaty that cannot be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , researched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ adi@@ c is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they can complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; passes to another family .
on the other hand , the family who receives the girl with her and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and might even be star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ill @-@ treated , his family will only be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the final punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his job .
their brothers had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went back home and had time for learning .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t have to eat in@@ definitely . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
on some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read leading newspaper articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he beha@@ ved intellig@@ ently , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose again , she explains .
but she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clearly that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cs in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author switched to the display again :
love friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll look if it works with her .

the business was completed .

bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently approved a draft bill to &quot; regulate the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law then a place would be established which is responsible for granting citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adoption of the law , users should register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law is enforced if it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration on users . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German @-@ conducting research techn@@ ologist ) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a trial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before going into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft will be in line with a pro @-@ military mode of thought in the Parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the scene , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening public order and insti@@ g@@ ating &quot; protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards that ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Per@@ si@@ can Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depend on the fact that there is a big predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passionate about another side of her country , which is not just war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wild animals are set up in the Kurdistan Region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the North East Japan , documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an Atom@@ ic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had spark@@ ed the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a several pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , alone because of this alone 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the Special Report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .

residential construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( in @-@ house ) , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u , were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ation of shel@@ ters ( in @-@ house , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) has to be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people who survived after the disaster in shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident took a large part in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of farm@@ land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear power zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far out@@ stri@@ pped .
the figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal residents find it more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to detect an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .

as for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in early 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 status , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people , who still live in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are known to reti@@ re because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by police in nationwide demonstrations

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had hit him with a bat@@ on against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ an@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer , as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ an@@ nia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a prot@@ esters and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire repression would thus be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media activist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several medi@@ cs soon run to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ an@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attended the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who hit him with a bat@@ on .
police Gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police missions against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate , and the typical violent acts of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the course of confrontation with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ agu@@ que , is widely known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others are res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories which are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad yields have not been any news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose before about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food @-@ Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane mills , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez was working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he most repeated , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said they were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closure , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ tima Ros@@ ales del Toro , but only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ shad@@ owed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba , and most important working platforms , was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the employment and services that were generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth talk of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane mills
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to waste it , they ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people also left the region .
a food factory has been created in the area , and its production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him .
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it using hip hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop conductors have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 for teaching youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop continues with the fact that the young participants learn topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sch @-@ calendar First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway to tears , &quot; a stretch of road in Western Canada , where almost two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and as well as our youth go forward
so they can do what they have appointed the Creator .
in the commentary part , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( customiz@@ able ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; ) are issued by each dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gent@@ ri@@ u .
now in special sale : new phone tapes , decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in the essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , we also have rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
you can look at further quir@@ ky plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ understand@@ ings and transmission often only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report on Dru@@ gs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
there are behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug trafficking &quot; ) , which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on a single day .
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare again today for the task that we have set ourselves , to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community conflicts , frag@@ ility and government leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article in Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensation@@ alism for a few years now .
I come every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the titles with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thought he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified by the fact that they were &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted from their business month by month , until they end not only destroyed the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain over it never fails , the trauma stays , the fear gets up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also have changed .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who has been murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was already past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of kill@@ ings according to the citizens &apos; council for public security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8,5 per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
few stories continue to live in the face of ever newer head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something sur@@ faced the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - den@@ ies the fact that there is ample careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region became dangerous roads full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to that .
local dign@@ it@@ aries described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ coal bodies that are lined up on the ground while people look at it .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically the atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo turned up again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this impro@@ per use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another step further brings forward personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely affecting the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image from S@@ ange has also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian intelligence site , which in 2012 had said that the President &apos;s Th@@ ein Being said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture from DR Congo to carry out this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated the picture of the DR Congo .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of this false coupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they originate from a mixed @-@ mas@@ h of private parties , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications , and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , occasionally others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries based on which side they were published . by this we want to show the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below , some examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases which can now be fully tra@@ cked ( on the map in orange ) :
board : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false coupling of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , will probably also show fal@@ si@@ fications .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was seen as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the picture from DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a Blog@@ gers to deli@@ mit alleg@@ ations that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government released a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos that international media , international human rights organisations and governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of od@@ ors used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the picture of DR Congo NOT shows Muslims to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar held Th@@ an &apos;s 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the image continues to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news page of An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was put into circulation later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were ties to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ eted ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message , supposedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
from the embassy in which the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries associated with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original press release of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that perme@@ ate these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming process uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
there are tens of thousands of people with social media who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this sen@@ timent of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . from time to time , these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that forci@@ ble images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ athy ( for example , this study investig@@ ates how forci@@ ble media works to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from the context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all possible to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ knife ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , so a complete explanation and sometimes a context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Appe@@ al to your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rück language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they dict@@ ate other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst flooding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood of flood and land@@ slides in this decade .
caused by mon@@ soon , which usually ends at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people were missed due to the floods and slu@@ dge av@@ alan@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people have been saved to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly returning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the beaten water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency shipments for the inhabitants of their flooded villages .
several organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us at 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button allowing users to pick up a vehicle for retri@@ eving assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , make people in need of emergency and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I have trusted her my four year old daughter , she confi@@ deth to me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some holding the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , tied out of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they have to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , have to be rehabil@@ itated .
to be ab@@ used
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace of mind ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western notion , religion was wi@@ ped out Rum@@ i , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ composed the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to temp@@ t them .
I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , faulty nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that over the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US failed to vote even her first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who were hi@@ ber@@ ed with slave vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous our collective imagination that Sik@@ h men and children are often aimed at anti @-@ sei@@ zing attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , of religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion euros
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed terri@@ bly to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims constitute the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ American Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents in New York came to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan re@@ thought the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were brave Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a sore Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , which all Muslims are carrying - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the pick@@ pockets with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no theological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and the way we tell them , there is anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger who puts the veil on a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ evening ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses for protection , which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging to me is the image of my grandmother on my mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; as they have decades ago , to win a competition for art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers they told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - col@@ oni@@ alized by an &quot; empire &quot; , which a company founded with the name Hon@@ orable British East In@@ dies Company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my acc@@ ent grandfather cries .
meanwhile , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family who was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alised &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aircraft bom@@ bed of history was disc@@ arded in a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ical subordin@@ ate of the British empire , was designated as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my musli@@ m tribe of 1.7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributing over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when tragedy comes home the US and the suspect is carrying a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that twenty @-@ four hundred years ago the first prayer call , called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a free black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple jun@@ ctions , but fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect in this two@@ fold structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registry operations , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that are bombing them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we throw at Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and due to those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study titled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ appropriate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are deeply dar@@ ed to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous forms of expression that we have in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry attempting to grasp our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing von Bu@@ zz@@ feeds ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ awi ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black American Muslims ; and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing that we are in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion mark . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is one reason for conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me a Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations will take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism , &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia studies network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars were w@@ aged and people were enth@@ ron@@ ed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago as a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I think in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we don &apos;t have a president , who bombs already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and di@@ gni@@ fy the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to the listener to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first present their story in their own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation lead to the audience getting involved .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bits and the bab@@ o@@ ons in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling tours .
Puerto Rico claims to re @-@ establish public debt from the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civi@@ c organizations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march launched at the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claims that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with no party affili@@ ation , focuses on socio @-@ economic development , a law on sovereign responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :

the sy@@ rian Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , there was a # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign event .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of books finished by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here for free , contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction , it says :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the list of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pre@@ dict@@ ably than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types combine with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ body this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bass@@ el gave me English even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a trial which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available for roy@@ alty free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an extract from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the prison of prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s arrest , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
during the time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate today our call for the hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption , Director after release again on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half his sentence , where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants for a pre@@ disposition of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ als ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money stem@@ med from public funds from Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose Council was headed by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company what happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which submitted the request , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company did not execute disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Security ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ d P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also introduce disciplinary proceedings against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently kept silent and did not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the relevant functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had left him .
he could give paid presentations and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to do harm .
so it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no mor@@ ale :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was unable to return mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he affir@@ ms that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocks the racial word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically ev@@ oke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spac@@ er ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts which are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ tor@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dissemin@@ ate hate speech have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China , such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat , have proven that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , with users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive , I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly er@@ ased posts .
if they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine where arguments between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than based on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law that should for@@ bid this practice so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now 18 .
before this amend@@ ment to the marriage law , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 , it came to a great public cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married among 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws on child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the Cri@@ tics of the Child before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was an un@@ complicated matter for tension , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children &apos;s marriage despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law announce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
after it was decided in the Senate beforehand , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the ministry of education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that veiled the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it lasted definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Tor@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that was quite open to the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years regardless of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft on the amend@@ ment to the marriage law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MPs who were opposed have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign use .
many thanks to all activists who fought it out .
congratulations .
a thanks to our dep@@ uties .
but a possible hook arrives in the shape of Sat @-@ Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organisation in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , the law was to be adopted , and he seems to release his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most of the social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Ur@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear satellite , if we , instead of talking about the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state , that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where child marriage is legal or continues to be the norm although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring websites Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again

for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and TV series fans defend themselves against the block .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using reloc@@ ating tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator hosts ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of legal prohibition , be retri@@ ev@@ able .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it in place to take sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents in distributed and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

a Nepal wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly I called to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already face to face to tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of Bu@@ cum@@ ber appeared . he immediately sits down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , its passion for promoting Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . it took up to 12 days until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ lawyers and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure to respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm while keeping this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced by a pseudo @-@ court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ aliz@@ ations to fear if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , took a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , run by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
it tells of how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion was women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves .
not to say lou@@ dly to the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this will be considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion done with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she only ch@@ ased before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the coming days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less intel@@ li@@ gible and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the vermi@@ lion dot on the forehead that indicates the married couple :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the chin @-@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an ou@@ ting at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes in their lives for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ine @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als associated with the coff@@ in and much more , Roh@@ ini made their own pair of cur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of their husband again .
some , including me , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navig@@ ating river .
by giving themselves self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives everyone of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 of this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be in@@ scribed on the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged remin@@ ders and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively interviewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ sa@@ aka , president of retail giant seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tokyo , 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial Site )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( from the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market @-@ driven technology , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will go today .
so , we hope you are there !

fine @-@ headed men are deported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that two @-@ headed men in Mozambique could be target of attacks .
photo : other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald @-@ headed persons for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently allowed to use the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a gl@@ atz@@ headed man could reveal gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aim of assass@@ inations for ob@@ scene purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the introduction of a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are aiming at ritual attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ anian police warned of the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already follows the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the wealth generation .
in recent days , three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique is facing :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ME shame a country in which people would have shame on walking on the street as if they would be ashamed to ask sex for good grades , and to take sex against good marks , a country in which people would be hun@@ ted for un@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; aimed at achieving fast wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mah@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter @-@ user , twe@@ et@@ ed that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ it@@ tering :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique &apos;s authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of gl@@ atz@@ ky people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were out@@ si@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials heard that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement will be the honour .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been in use for their release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared forci@@ bly are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people is unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( sovereign risk ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokesman said he did not need to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release him or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Affairs B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Liberia &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon fishing to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
as a result of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as announced on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits that they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA Isra@@ ë@@ l begin the
&quot; &quot; &quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it assists him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy calls on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told me that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , based on the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can get into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and the United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing at the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the Bub@@ ble around Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide appropriate medical care to Li@@ u and to give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release restrictions on the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and the United States
the State Department of France asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June .
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where , and also his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that no further information will be available whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental European Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished could have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the International branch of the state of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be seen as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , what country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , it appeared inv@@ ari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again by the author@@ itarian rulers who pret@@ end to be demo@@ crats , leaving the distorted logic , since they are better suited to their power .
in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ciary , our political system .
he tar@@ ned certain questions with non @-@ responses ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points to the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ evenly important even if we enjoyed free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - either I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , associate it correctly and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review sheds light on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our prime minister bill ?
what is the value of our pink HR ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of &quot; nice Canadi@@ ans &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the most recent part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in its inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook with anger inside when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there &apos;s little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there is no weapon for us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we clearly say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also said to be the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called a &quot; nice &quot; means to be fun - like the nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one of his own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
that can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal feature of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just bold pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band presents Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to rule .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and got 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the state of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these shots of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army that monitors online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy is prosec@@ uted .
Thailand implements a strict temper@@ ament against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black vans , before bringing them into intern@@ ment camps , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it is now over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zi@@ an war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ est@@ al depic@@ t striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ eu@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , East @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most Russians and abor@@ tions live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost@@ ly cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ han@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ ch@@ uk@@ w@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ ying and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to quit this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , serving all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded opul@@ ent buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as they discover me with the camera in their hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ en@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the District Administration supplies free @-@ charge candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insist that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you are on holiday , we will visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s talk partner Nat@@ asha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us .

a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ ying buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure authenticity in their lives .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez introduces a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59 year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bri@@ ll frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel , but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you from Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and bring her to the hospital when she is ill ; she bu@@ ys medicines that she cannot pay , she masks the feet of the long journey with a bal@@ m .
ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ om Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , however it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger , a single woman , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is back full of guests .
in the pas@@ sage@@ ways , travellers calm@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves a lot of photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , young and old .
she laughs sadly , while she imag@@ ines her short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 10 July , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of U@@ rum@@ qi were given a cell phone notification in which they as@@ cri@@ be to the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app would determine and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution paths of the terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ing &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is the blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control their own home network remotely .
this app with min@@ ors for min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; may enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focuses on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those living in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( featured promin@@ ently at the top of the page ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the inhabitants indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the X@@ inj@@ an authorities ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point using a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the statements of the city council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal contents .
all branches of government , authorities and the party associated with the party , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June , the authorities issued a decree in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ leep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activist is Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who makes all honor to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality catches you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform themselves into beings from flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone have erected .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the boss of the security service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to destroy the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters desired , only my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that has been stuffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the fourth quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we joined to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly .
in such a moment you are aware that you are releasing the Spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel of Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar , or you &apos;re only brave enough to shout when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of that building .
perhaps it was due to my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary and his father right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal to his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture that I had been exposed to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I feel all the details exactly before I enter the room .
in other words , this time they have assigned me a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share with only one more prisoner and I can set myself immediately without waiting for permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ fashioned communication method : hitting the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ rate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness no striking facial features can be seen in me , and there are no doctors here ; we &apos;re all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
liar .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ e on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( like : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th Sur@@ a of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was venti@@ lated : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and revealed the close eye @-@ view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that are der@@ ailed to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
to serve in all their diversity .
his command is to pull me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ ths .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cab@@ al from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in line .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I ceased to cry .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not take pleasure in doing so , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electri@@ cally loaded rod .
electricity just passed my entire body , enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours went out that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about terrible sorrow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and hurry , you &apos;ll be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ?
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bs to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine spotted lips .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as rock ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist , opposing the conservative majority and questioning her old @-@ time opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ental alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by limits , and he can feel according to his own testimony with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b examines his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he sh@@ ook Nes@@ café in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot day &apos;s day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speak flu@@ ffy coffee and the che@@ ats of the K@@ ent cig@@ ar in the nose primarily talk of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which asks the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ all@@ ising reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly tro@@ dden woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in the past few years the number of &apos; hon@@ or@@ ships &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been subjected to murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic effort as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , the full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I became a politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song one verse is repeated notic@@ e@@ ably often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a sort of market on which you can , in his words , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular J@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to mention later that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and in his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ova , a poet from the 8th century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ ova , who would later work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian realm , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former government ministers and members of the teaching alliance , argu@@ ing that they had critically comments on comments on social media related to the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has fought M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not through bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial type @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until it is time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from western Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two trucks are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

outside appearance and personal care have rarely been as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rape and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the out@@ lan@@ dish hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) has led to more and more normal citizens go into the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; competition , which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ rilla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga of the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young Youth Foundation , inspired by the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la A@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla fighters .
only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in continual fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ rilla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would have to gather together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter who will then be delivered personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more need@@ less .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most pressing attention this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from Ja@@ veri@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC arose as they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ rilla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gr@@ en@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly my tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else of life than a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
to kick off , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people , who had never heard of hearing and had no voting rights , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated humans with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all men , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian people were told that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , raise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be facing many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and its first publication on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs around the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , like a women &apos;s sword , has not emerged only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya captured the international head@@ lines after reports of the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic addressed .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
ever since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of her life she went to the United States in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I accepted her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eradic@@ ate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken everything along and started shou@@ ting .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : what nur@@ ses have you been placed in - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very grateful to him for this .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got scared to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
I received threats in February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that this was all a lie .
they posed absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by going up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ sn@@ y &apos;s official television and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family attempted to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something lazy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering me , without any identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you are safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
why are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not complete a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are just not many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to establish itself in Cad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be present as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but purpos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was detained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ sn@@ y when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually dump@@ ed us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were t@@ apped ; I had coloured eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one often says it to children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period hold ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how the people in the city began to change .
those who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before looked at you once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the worsen@@ ing of the situation in the republic .
OC Media : which activity do you go after ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have to pay a cent for that .
I discovered these people themselves when I picked up a variety of species .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as T@@ ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the D@@ age@@ stan@@ es have what the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet , they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims practicing in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of a transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now already more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , as Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who wish to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube gave the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more .
he died shortly after .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all the fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 made great efforts to put an end to ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s to diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have led only to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , finished 55 % secondary school and 45 % have graduated from university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian human rights activist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not recru@@ iting Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the cross sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside .
for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is known to me and known to me .
I am convinced that I bond twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial discrimination and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists adopt .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to &quot; sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of the women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to institution@@ alised violence , which we expose black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her thinking , which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings which , through cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric agenda .
I will no longer try to tell white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender , because some of them will continue to teach the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join me in the movement of femin@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming oneself ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of being able to create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately called separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a v@@ ague environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ski@@ pped nor ignored nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this entry by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan Region of Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I desper@@ ately wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are concerned that decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , poorly respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and novel multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of structural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said her testimony would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman was shown Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos; well @-@ informed ad was not useful .
a few days later , the second woman returned to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women allow ads to be displayed at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report to the law enforcement authorities .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Be@@ atings and statisti@@ cally 2 invisible mal@@ treatment and a judicial system that has nothing to do with 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate realization pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District Prosec@@ ution filed 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements reported by the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too , 86 % of the ads were viewed by women .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is unable to adver@@ tise in Paraguay due to psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who failed to do so come to any woman who is unable to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 alone , journalists en@@ um@@ er@@ ated at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable :
I never thought I would have been a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that only women are happening that are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mal@@ treatment of Carlos Vera .
without names , she wrote articles on fac@@ ebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had liked the so long of Carlos and did not leave him in the past .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victori@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives , they received no support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she carried out a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law proposes to explain Fem@@ ales to an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as is the case already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the text has been changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law which feared that it would pa@@ ve the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ishable with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill fores@@ aw the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must be borne by the victims of violence at present , if they simply allow ads and want to obtain a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
there must be a re@@ thinking here , so that violence is not considered to be a normal thing .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the cul@@ mination of the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to pay as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes are falling apart .
the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a major set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on the website of the banned newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Cuban authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were arrested and arrested , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he is the main office in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restrictions and torture rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ cer@@ ate .
the authorities systematically restrict the peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported in the beginning of 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested a paper entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to the hands of the judi@@ ciary &quot; on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an estate dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was sum@@ mon@@ ed by the ISS and arrested by the security forces on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS hosted the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , is prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i was held before the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , because of the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison terms and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit was fixed in the amount of 5000 Afghan ri@@ al ( US $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment announced .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he will serve his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re@@ pay the publication of the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated in Oman .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country to cease operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Cuban authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Cuban authorities to :
1 . to release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under any circum@@ stance , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble , support and protect themselves .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all . it is a growing area which addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have more serious implications in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the phar@@ ma companies is a major problem .
second , the research undertaken by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa . a larger role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself explored the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GV : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
R@@ W : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
R@@ W : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
R@@ W : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
R@@ W : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific education , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience ?
R@@ W : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that journals should only make articles accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 different varieties such as Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents do not only support individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as grain or cart@@ el species , and because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are responsible for food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it needs longer since its work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der is lying in a river to which I have to be bl@@ unt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the United States and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have produced and eaten red red@@ dish sal@@ at of the Out@@ standing Invent@@ ory variety at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source seed initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free open source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders are only allowing others who buy seeds to breed it , to breed their own varieties , and not immediately pron@@ ounce - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater cohesi@@ on , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by spe@@ eding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the ever increasing mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , as it is for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened .
food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly diverse intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus becoming increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about one third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to use either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or color improves to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and maintain threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is more unnecessary now than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable .
in an email Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to be : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers their job easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form it itself and as a bree@@ der we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , Plant Bre@@ eding Plant in Oregon and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , in whose cultivation it is necessary to produce large quantities of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I was working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , with which you can make it quite simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be leading the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , performs an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Os@@ si &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si commitment cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office into implementing this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed system , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source seed seed systems , scheduled for next year &apos;s official launch .
an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - publishes a report . it believes farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , paid particular attention to where and how it is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) website , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains - in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network of Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of Web site closures to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes in Egypt , not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he addressed was to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider that is also home to the blog of Canada &apos;s blog , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while telling about the student protests and taking a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced his government and reflected what this meant for him :
blocking the blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs and any other web site I worked for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , by circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called virtual private networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the closure of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
the situation is additionally ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants dispute .
the Brazilian Army deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a town in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers all over Brazil report with glo@@ omy lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old is shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is assass@@ inated in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bery pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air port to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16 published an editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , differs from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the &quot; War in Rio &quot; section . ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the paper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
this is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure atro@@ cities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , argues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ as per State , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela through the use of a massive police custody and to permanently station@@ ed a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio serves as a war as well as serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war . this includes penet@@ rating the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ational bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
it is now a week that the police come up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : taught Syri@@ ans to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , causing residents to be smu@@ g@@ gled on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen . however , their food @-@ quality makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of plant@@ ation of mushrooms such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Do until Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
locally produced plastic fuels are used for fuel scar@@ city to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Production of Mus@@ h@@ rooms originating from the Regi@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people about mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in areas of crisis and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower .
fires have also been registered in the region of Gal@@ icia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
the whole of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread across the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to contain the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching reform proposal introduced by the government following serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and further as in a vi@@ cious circle .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as residents of information sought or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from a refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Africa for the last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara Taliban , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and he made him sick .
then he took that which was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar which were heavier than himself to earn his living .
at that time , as today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af recalled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we weren &apos;t freezing at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ m came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high demand rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are , are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his stub@@ born li@@ fes@@ pan helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions .
after he had spent several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ ack@@ snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - ein Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ ans operated by Afgh@@ ans , including d@@ ress@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan .
but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim back to the country , which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; wherever there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ging plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
he has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans along this path .
ne@@ tizen &apos;s report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on clearing the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Foto von @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 shared on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen &apos;s report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in world @-@ wide Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must register to be able to use social networks within six months of the rule of law on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number .
anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of punishment .
the law which has been applied by sixty members of parliament is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member of the Parliament reached a law proposition , in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the insul@@ t of the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law , such a deed would , however , be punished with prison sentences and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
just as more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan had four years in prison for a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false charges of including cease @-@ fire , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists on le@@ aked documents inter@@ ro@@ gated
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a le@@ aked action plan . said plan stems from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all un@@ law@@ fully received funds .
this document , published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans seem to support the legislative situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of his sources stating the article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which journalists covered the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to present their badge ?
according to new regulations from the Council of People &apos;s Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that this will eliminate the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to sel@@ ectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register with the state government as an &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to the Russian government exec@@ uting a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ stri@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
tur@@ k@@ ish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication gave that the site was blocked because it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source working together with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would comp@@ el Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time and install Backdoor programs to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
in spite of all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
