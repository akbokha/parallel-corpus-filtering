<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were willing to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely according to Method Man," "" "It's like that's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in multitudes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections was the highest number that a candidate who was nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing human, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung also agreed with the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer" by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I had met with our joint love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Feiney, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump knew his way to nominees Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (meaning. Ü): as much as "white against all other ethnicities"; word play from white in allusions to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like the big Van Jones, has killed just that which America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people all over the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its president, twice the son of an expert, whose history, as he himself says, would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trumps Land now, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of the Anunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments consisting of local solid waste materials is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced by rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tonnes of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of Cateurah, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset about this and were not inclined to welcome a criminal to this species at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: it did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are, apart from Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that the Prime Minister had driven out of their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand out mutually where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic obstacles and also through the snail stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions are happening in real-time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. such suspicious driving routes can be detected, such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly if they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">On the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such vessels in their harbours. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, actions include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasies, fishes, protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a land could then say" "" "You may not start my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "". "" "" "and that exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found escape ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international crime against crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">Illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, head analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminally operating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth co-opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and marine conservation organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown anywhere in the world using the position of each traceable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detract criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had been fished without a license and had hardly expected to face the consequences are now aware that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover ever since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa millions of dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined forces with the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia has reported its first great triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship flying under false flag. and not only was the ship travel without a license and were used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also entered forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal for them to go against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">The street movement in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are seen as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's motion to a referendum on the exercise of office, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void, having gathered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: Venezuela's regression) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also carried out in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central North located Bundestaat, Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, co-author at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine, the referendum on taking office was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (like the round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups were united, summoned the trial against President Nicolás Maduro, as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the city of Maracay, centrally located north-north.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government, according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic shows the round, which covers the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - it was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret maid.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the scale of atrocities he had experienced as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power is a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>

<seg id="350">Revision of the original photograph by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who made the local newspapers aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for translation errors. furthermore, it stated that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a little more detailed about the phenomenon of the "fearsome" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, who might produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese team, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints which often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewelry. but from large corporations or from government who have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navette con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups that oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was snapped, and advised users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites Venezuelan providers are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Deals like Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turbulences.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsingeltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible due to a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two more online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests from certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrectly or refuses the request when calling this website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV was on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the Internet links: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>

<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the house of her employer between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went back home and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't have to eat indefinitely. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the host Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read leading newspaper articles such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he behaved intelligently, but did not stay with her." "" "the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn" "" "bad habits" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "even at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against." "" "a thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment exposed to Criaditas when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clearly that I belonged to no group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, edited by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently approved a draft bill to "regulate the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if it is accepted by Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law then a place would be established which is responsible for granting citizens a permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of adoption of the law, users should register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law is enforced if it is accepted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration on users. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">"" "Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password" "" "to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German-conducting research technologist) at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "if I take them seriously, it means they will establish a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a trial." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before going into the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft will be in line with a pro-military mode of thought in the Parliament, in which the control is maximized and assured that no deviating narration is present on the scene, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening public order and instigating "protest."</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of the leopards that roams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the North East Japan, documented the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an Atomic accident in Fukushima had sparked the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a several prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, as the tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, alone because of this alone 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Special Report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (in-house), saigai kouei juutaku, were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of shelters (in-house, casetsu juchaku) has to be relocated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 were still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who survived after the disaster in shelters were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident took a large part in the three prefectures of farmland.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima are located in the "nuclear power zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far outstripped.</seg>
<seg id="567">The figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal residents find it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to detect an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she questioned her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo paper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 status, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated people, who still live in shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are known to retire because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had hit him with a baton against his head during a demonstration in Goiannia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a baton. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás reported that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, as he strikes in Goiannia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a protesters and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire repression would thus be justified.</seg>

<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiannia while lying in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father because he was sabotaging the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have attended the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who hit him with a baton.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Grips</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police missions against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where protesters had set up a stage for orators, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have slipped street protests by focusing on another, unexpected protagonist: a windshield.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustratively shape their titles with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is absurd, disproportionate, and the typical violent acts of the military police are obscured by headlines with the title "protesters on the course of confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Cuba's Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane mills in Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayaguque, is widely known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane mills were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others are resigned and commuting daily to the factories which are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is up every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad yields have not been any news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose before about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food-Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely enter history," "" "said the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane mills, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez was working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he most repeated, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said they were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closure, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ultima Rosales del Toro, but only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was overshadowed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop conductors have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 for teaching youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop continues with the fact that the young participants learn topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsch-calendar First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway to tears," a stretch of road in Western Canada, where almost two dozen most indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and as well as our youth go forward</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have appointed the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to syllables (which is also published on his blog and republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, the shokuhin sanpuru ("plastic models of the courts") are issued by each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin gentriu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new phone tapes, decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, we also have rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can look at further quirky plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on Drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking"), which should give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community conflicts, fragility and government leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal político, wrote this article in Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensationalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come every day to newspaper kiosks and see the titles with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thought he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he's big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village would be justified by the fact that they were "rebellious."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family was looted from their business month by month, until they end not only destroyed the business, but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never fails, the trauma stays, the fear gets up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also have changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself whether crying would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who has been murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was already past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of killings according to the citizens' council for public security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor had 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8,5 per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of ever newer headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the streets in the region became dangerous roads full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to that.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local dignitaries described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>

<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically the atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo turned up again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this improper use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="853">The image from Sange has also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian intelligence site, which in 2012 had said that the President's Thein Being said, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture from DR Congo to carry out this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that permeate these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing process uses the image to discuss how African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are tens of thousands of people with social media who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this sentiment of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. from time to time, these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to empathy (for example, this study investigates how forcible media works to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from the context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all possible to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobreknife).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, so a complete explanation and sometimes a context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist from "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Appeal to your parents in recognition of how they have been striving for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrück language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- the comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They dictate other cultures, reveal other thoughts, and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and dignify the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to the listener to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first present their story in their own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and representation lead to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the story of the rabbits and the baboons in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling tours.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civic organizations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march launched at the Puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrian Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, there was a # FreeBassel campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books finished by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here for free, contains a series of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction, it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create a sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the list of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Memory gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and wants to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us start thinking about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police had taken the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more predictably than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types combine with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to embody this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a trial which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half his sentence, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for a predisposition of 54 million Meticals (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money stemmed from public funds from Mozambique's airports, whose Council was headed by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which submitted the request, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post, since the company did not execute disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Security (Centro de Integrid Pública (CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system," "" "says CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also introduce disciplinary proceedings against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent and did not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had left him.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid presentations and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to do harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">So it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">To the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza was unable to return morals and to serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind a thief in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel will not only be remembered for ever as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, incisive and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he affirms that "an ambitious person is capable of all, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "calar" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spacer), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it extinguishes all the posts which are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on factorook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate speech have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat, have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, with users of social networks simply going to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook directive, I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "did not correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly erased posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "" "" "Facebook" "" "censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which did not contain hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the territory of Rakhine where arguments between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than based on code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children married to 15 were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married among 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeavored to abolish laws on child marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the Critics of the Child before they were supposed to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was an uncomplicated matter for tension, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children's marriage despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law announce." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted again on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate beforehand, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial office in the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that veiled the core of the thing, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it lasted definitely long enough to abolish practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentral - Thomas, which says:, "Excellent news!</seg>

<seg id="1365">Torade Mutota, a member of the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that was quite open to the importance of the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>

<seg id="1367">The draft on the amendment to the marriage law was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal steps, the law was to be adopted, and he seems to release his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most of the social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Urrell suggested:</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>

<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and TV series fans defend themselves against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using relocating tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN-prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator hosts), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of legal prohibition, be retrievable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put all of it in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents in distributed and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonny of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, when Wikipedia is closed in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You get access to another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A bowing rhinoceros, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepalese wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly I called to Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepalese nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already face to face to tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the King of Bucumber appeared. he immediately sits down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, its passion for promoting Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent in order to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. it took up to 12 days until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalylawyers and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure to respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm while keeping this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced by a pseudo-court from the Indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after she had addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer realizations to fear if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel as well as housewives, took a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, run by the community Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells of how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in its discussion was women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to say loudly to the names of their husbands is a custom that they all dutifully uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this will be considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini launched her first discussion club with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion done with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition where married women never dare to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only chased before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustrated frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the coming days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put into the head of women: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less intelligible and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the vermilion dot on the forehead that indicates the married couple:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the chin-red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an outing at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes in their lives for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a Saline-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, the morals associated with the coffin and much more, Rohini made their own pair of curtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of their husband again.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling around more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a heavily navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving themselves self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 of this year the hashtag was to be inscribed on the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged reminders and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached its zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>

<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely need to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>

<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is the Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course, some companies also use the fan community in terms of market-driven technology, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is the Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald-headed persons for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently allowed to use the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a glatzheaded man could reveal gold or bring wealth, explained the police spokesman of Zambézia the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of assassinations for obscene purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the introduction of a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already follows the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the wealth generation.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha told Facebook the chronicle of the blog's poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique is facing:</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo drew attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(sovereign risk), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "internal affair" "" "and a spokesman said he did not need to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release him or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liberia's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon fishing to China, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">As a result of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as announced on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1673">The Council of continental European Affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and demonstrate a greater tolerance towards those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>

<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished could have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the International branch of the state of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be seen as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, what country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, it appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, it has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again by the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, since they are better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarned certain questions with non-responses rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points to the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire address of the conference in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so unevenly important even if we enjoyed free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - either I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, associate it correctly and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sheds light on Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "make a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister bill?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink HR ID?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumours about certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The most recent part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in its interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians probably cook with anger inside when they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know each other, there's little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, being called a "nice" means to be fun - like the natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Die Simpsons" (who has one of his own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no edges and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a principal feature of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders describe as "nice" is perhaps just bold politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59 year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink brill frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel, but hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "where are you from Mama Africa?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring her to the hospital when she is ill; she buys medicines that she cannot pay, she masks the feet of the long journey with a balm.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">"" "we feel very comfortable here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, however it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answered, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet her or report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night offered.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger, a single woman, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika, everything is back full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the passageways, travellers calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, mobile users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification in which they ascribe to the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities would also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would determine and prosecute the sources and distribution paths of the terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwaning's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to control their own home network remotely.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors for minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" may enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mainly focuses on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those living in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" (featured prominently at the top of the page), the censored news published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the inhabitants indiscriminately whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The Xinjan authorities ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint using a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description, indicating that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the statements of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, authorities and the party associated with the party, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June, the authorities issued a decree in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slumbs to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel had completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as rock yeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioning her old-time opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by limits, and he can feel according to his own testimony with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he has a special dislike against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib examines his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he shook Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in that time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot day's day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speak fluffy coffee and the cheats of the Kent cigar in the nose primarily talk of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which asks the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallising reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender men by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly trodden woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years the number of 'honorships' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have been subjected to murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely," and for their release often requires years of bureaucratic effort as well as the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, the full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and opinion, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I became a politician," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse is repeated noticeably often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market on which you can, in his words," "" "get what you want" "" "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordan online program Roya, to mention later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and in his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuova, a poet from the 8th century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuova, who would later work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemian realm, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former government ministers and members of the teaching alliance, arguing that they had critically comments on comments on social media related to the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has fought Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificial type-led democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is time, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies marched from western Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two trucks are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearance and personal care have rarely been as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street rape and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the outlandish hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to more and more normal citizens go into the seasoned hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the "Batalla de Barberos" competition, which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressers and to receive training in hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because from love to the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga of the foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation, inspired by the campaign Cartas por la Aliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in continual fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to gather together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who will then be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more needless.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most pressing attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC arose as they had done earlier to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and anything in between," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "Hello, what do you do right now?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "suddenly my tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else of life than a war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To kick off, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years, we have experienced the social injustice done by the state to the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people, who had never heard of hearing and had no voting rights, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated humans with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all men, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people were told that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, raise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be facing many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the lap through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you shame?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything along and started shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what nurses have you been placed in - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got scared to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats in February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They posed absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by going up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grosny's official television and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family attempted to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without any identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you are safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Why are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I desire, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not complete a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to establish itself in Cadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be present as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposefully submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports about it. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to bring us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually dumped us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were tapped; I had coloured eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period hold?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed before looked at you once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the worsening of the situation in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have to pay a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I picked up a variety of species.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tchetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have what the Cabardines have, the Russians also have; on the whole planet, they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims practicing in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of a transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now already more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August brought the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, as Ahwazi human rights groups who wish to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube gave the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly after.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all the fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arabic Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 made great efforts to put an end to ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams to divert water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have led only to devastate the devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, finished 55% secondary school and 45% have graduated from university.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohii, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicides among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions prefer not recruiting Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists strike alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zurichi and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves an intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is known to me and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I bond twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial discrimination and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists adopt.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to" sing "Kumbaya, my Lord, in order to achieve equal rights (some) of the women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence in addition to institutionalised violence, which we expose black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate to the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851 Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanly and marginalized being in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings which, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to tell white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender, because some of them will continue to teach the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women attempt to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join me in the movement of feminism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming oneself (about: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of being able to create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a vague environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither skipped nor ignored nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said her testimony would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman was shown Balbuena for abuse, the Ada Báez 'well-informed ad was not useful.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned to her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women allow ads to be displayed at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should report to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>

"there are different statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Prosecution filed 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements reported by the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too, 86% of the ads were viewed by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">"" "" "" "however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is unable to advertise in Paraguay due to psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "at the end of 2014, two women who failed to do so come to any woman who is unable to do so." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016 alone, journalists enumerated at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that takes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then gave up. this should be regretted forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would have been a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that only women are happening that are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the maltreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without names, she wrote articles on facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had liked the so long of Carlos and did not leave him in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for nearly eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" "), which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"" "" "" "Victorias" "" "advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also by their relatives, they received no support." ""</seg>
<seg id="2524">She carried out a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable judicial struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied." ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">"" "" "" "the original draft of the law proposes to explain Females to an independent criminal offense and to punish the harsher as is the case already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2532">"" "" "" "thus the text has been changed in some points in order to also win the MPs for the law which feared that it would pave the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years imprisonment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill foresaw the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must be borne by the victims of violence at present, if they simply allow ads and want to obtain a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a rethinking here, so that violence is not considered to be a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the culmination of the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to pay as long as abuse is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes are falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The Sultans rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, public liberties, including press freedom, restrictions and torture rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to torture, intimidate and incarcerate.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict the peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, because of the disorder of the public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "undermining the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his permission</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all. it is a growing area which addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious implications in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharma companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research undertaken by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa. a larger role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself explored the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices: what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am just starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receiver instead of being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable for use in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa vs. Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that journals should only make articles accessible against payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 different varieties such as Outstanding Gorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents do not only support individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as grain or cartel species, and because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are responsible for food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it needs longer since its work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder is lying in a river to which I have to be blunt." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the United States and around the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have produced and eaten red reddish salat of the Outstanding Inventory variety at the "greenhouse" of the station. it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source seed initiative (Initiative for Open Source seed) can be inspired by the movement for free open source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was founded in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are therefore permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can agree that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" breeders are only allowing others who buy seeds to breed it, to breed their own varieties, and not immediately pronounce - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater cohesion, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by speeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and takes on the ever increasing mergers in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, as it is for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly diverse intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus becoming increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to use either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat in even greater style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have targeted features - from those through which their taste or color improves to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and maintain threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is more unnecessary now than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an email Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property protects other breeders because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to be: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers their job easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it itself and as a breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, Plant Breeding Plant in Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, in whose cultivation it is necessary to produce large quantities of herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets but smaller than Monsanto) patents, most smaller seed companies can also survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I was working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years" "", "he says." "" "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, with which you can make it quite simple." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) website, which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains - in spite of this attack and the ridicule of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 web pages more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of Web site closures to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he writes in Egypt, not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he addressed was to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider that is also home to the blog of Canada's blog, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while telling about the student protests and taking a video on how police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced his government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking the blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs and any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, by circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called virtual private networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the closure of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally aggravated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo of: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers all over Brazil report with gloomy lines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old is shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is assassinated in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves robbery pharmacy with military weapons," President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air port to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 wave of violence reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting of violence in Rio on August 16 published an editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, differs from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the "War in Rio" section. (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the paper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">This is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to obscure atrocities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordras per State, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a Favela through the use of a massive police custody and to permanently stationed a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010 explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio serves as a war as well as serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war. this includes penetrating the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "irrational bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police come up with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, causing residents to be smuggled on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" "" "life-saving food source" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional ones planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen. however, their food-quality makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and waiters." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families knowledge of plantation of mushrooms such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to raise funds to CanDo until Monday, September 4th, 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state shower.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires have also been registered in the region of Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the Federation of Farmers of Portugal explained the paper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of readily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, spread further and further as in a vicious circle.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as residents of information sought or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the people with information: they used their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara Taliban, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Several days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and he made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took that which was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar which were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site on which we worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we weren't freezing at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashareholm came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high demand rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are, are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be drawn up for months after the registration of the asylum seeker.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his stubborn lifespan helped Asharaf to liberate himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After he had spent several years working in the construction industry, Ashark put all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snacksnack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis Success Story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - ein Hazara in Italy") director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghans operated by Afghans, including dressors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan businessman Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim back to the country, which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"wherever there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forging plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>

<seg id="2928">Netizen's report: bill drafts from Egypt enable shutdown social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on clearing the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the release of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Foto von @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen's report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in world-wide Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register to be able to use social networks within six months of the rule of law on the website of the authority stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or a penalty of punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law which has been applied by sixty members of parliament is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member of the Parliament reached a law proposition, in which tougher penalties would be introduced for the insult of the president or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law, such a deed would, however, be punished with prison sentences and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly is in danger already for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan), who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Just as more than 700 protesters arrested at the same incident, Shawkan had four years in prison for a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatened the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, false charges of including cease-fire, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were accused of reporting on the pro-Morsi session block at Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists on leaked documents interrogated</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a leaked action plan. said plan stems from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial bill that would guarantee business people and the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they return all unlawfully received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on April 21, on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans seem to support the legislative situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the naming of his sources stating the article 11 of the Tunisian press code which journalists covered the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China compel the users of social media to present their badge?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations from the Council of People's Office of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will eliminate the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat has failed to register with the state government as an "organiser of the distribution of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to the Russian government executing a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently websites like Vkontakte and Odnostriniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court decreed the blocking of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia's administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication gave that the site was blocked because it" "" "an information source working together with groups to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers, which would compel Internet service providers to monitor communications in real-time and install Backdoor programs to decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In spite of all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
