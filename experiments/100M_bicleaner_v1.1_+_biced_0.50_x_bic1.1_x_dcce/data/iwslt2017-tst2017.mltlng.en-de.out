that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times journalist .
long before anyone of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the NSA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally passed Iran blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
the government opposed the Ris@@ en government for almost 10 years and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional happened .
suddenly , despite the fact that it was essential for their case for many years , the demands of the government were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also have his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly concerned his telephone intelligence ,
as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit revenue , and even travel ID with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ky alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments together .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more ways to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they receive contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ dropping , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot proc@@ ure any more information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to do mis@@ deeds . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers and who wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who warns the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a wall @-@ street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that king@@ doms and powerful &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a 2 billion US dollar bill leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of child days , a famous cel@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
it sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s book or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying out from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conc@@ eal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ z@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those containers .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revelations , this scandal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable c@@ utt@@ ings .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals for how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covered investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior .
it may sound as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot that something has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years we have seen advances towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see these Panama revelations , this vast insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale of my own farm .
one guy stayed in the red Maz@@ da and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a wild alien is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed , sne@@ aked at the toe pointed to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pulled out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so @-@ called &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham liners tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ us czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the Internet , they can then invite exotic people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can remember the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we are striving for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ seated neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can read not only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in her hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
in this way , most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al G@@ ores Handy now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is can@@ adi@@ ed for the President &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name ; if he had told where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to reject any negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their ratings before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they relate to age and residence .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sets out common@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get cheaper .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make a vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dis@@ miss those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a demand that had not been covered beforehand .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who illeg@@ ally celebrated parties or apartments rav@@ aged .
hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain .
at the beginning of the project , I worked in the customer service department . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
because people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , it can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks because of se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can only recommend it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , not every stay is running .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is comparable with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one in a tavern tour of which one has never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing common share ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a lead were now offered .
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ators programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 5,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest in a foreign or even host night .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ ous@@ el fitness fan@@ ati@@ cal ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born this way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ st myself .
no , not as a hom@@ osexual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my he@@ address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you supp@@ ressing yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , in comparison to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever have the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I got married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking out . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should we do something like this ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... , ... &quot; Dest@@ ru@@ ction Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin construction studies .
I remember how I felt swe@@ ating -- so deep it went down to my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the sentim@@ ents were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims , cr@@ ushing into the open and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have received the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually hear people saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is located as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque causes people to consider other beliefs more tolerant , and show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a head of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of ra@@ dic@@ alization , one has noticed that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from the faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their fur@@ y , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the Mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neurological studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows : if people present news reports in which it was reported negative about Muslims , they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms all of us .
in the allocation of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion free .
we decided for the mosque .
we kept silent with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure at the mosque .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , athei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had bra@@ ined courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go safe on number ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are better than those who believe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
thank you nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ talk , a ment@@ or with depth , working in a noble think tank , i.e. an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the largest study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package has penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the public . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in a tigh@@ test space .
you can also build load@@ able structures on your own .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
an aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers , it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flies with only one function .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no folders , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no more actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern rigi@@ dity . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the bu@@ d is an exercise in car@@ el@@ essness , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some of them are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the others anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or battery - the machine can fly further , even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half of the flight un@@ fit .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes orbit@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y . they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
for this short moment they sh@@ ined more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was secre@@ ted into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events in the first place .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell lives were created on earth .
since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation funded their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
this is why it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes reigned through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick Father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a cr@@ us@@ her in the structure of space and time .
when passing the wave , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead a really foolish dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed when the waves hit . the stretch of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a followed by 1 . wher@@ eu@@ pon people declared that the League staff was crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne posted this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott happily claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create an image or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
this is different when it comes to sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity , we can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott is busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , straight : w@@ up@@ p !
when the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . that sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date , which at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o following : &#91; Sur@@ render the noise &#93; No one knows what he needs to hear , acknow@@ le@@ dges this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the bars of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to discover the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about space .
the exciting physical processes happen however at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , since these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos , but we will never see them , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o it ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , on the formation of the stars and ultimately , how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circul@@ ating of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared was eliminated my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my bill of be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I would swear to always play with them once you call me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; sag@@ as saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , stir you up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cir@@ cled TV . I produce TV .
I do television , in a big style .
in this season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment boasts hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days , 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes at the same time : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : show To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my television series run one after another on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , country or classroom , take me seriously when I speak about work so that you understand that I don &apos;t just run around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am en@@ gros@@ sed in my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a result , one toler@@ ates a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clinical and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the tot@@ als .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the tot@@ ality is action and activity . the tot@@ als is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the tot@@ als are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing then you can not strive differently than by size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not do@@ omed to failure , and I only know that I love the tot@@ ality .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more broad@@ casts the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the sums , the tot@@ als .
I like this h@@ um . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz stopped .
the hum@@ ming of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t like my job any more . the engine was off .
the sum did not come back .
my sw@@ am was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , re@@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , no deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ p .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fa@@ des ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hire yourself today , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you do , you are working , one loves to be a teacher , to be a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you a hum@@ ming when you know the tot@@ als , when the hum@@ ming stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become conscious of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ätz@@ chen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz@@ ing bu@@ ds , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ o , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet feet , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; lets go .
everywhere peace and simplicity is .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ als , the sums of work , the sum of titanium , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television hours and how functioning my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sum is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ ality is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice unless I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not as easy to me as working .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be compared to house ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of these is that I am too relaxed .
we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and if my teen@@ ie &apos;s daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can get up for 15 minutes , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are in there !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ ality of having a place for peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own kids . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find it out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I will win . friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes by piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the tot@@ als came back in my spare time . the tot@@ als then seem to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the tot@@ als is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my Sum@@ ma .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
the tot@@ ality of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ g to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan Poker playing a trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the other , the right sums : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life spreads in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I &apos;ll raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you nice .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical procedures .
they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ pl@@ uses an electro@@ de in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits so that the neurological function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior medical doctor and worked day and night in the emergency department .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in case of skull @-@ brain trauma , the brain is s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of the cran@@ ial mass .
instead of disc@@ arding the s@@ wollen case of the brain , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a piece of cloth is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may also know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we re@@ directed it to the receiving point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made a violation and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we colored in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured in the motor cor@@ tex the hand moti@@ le area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
he is not as precise and not as fast .
now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation .
I can tell you this was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely will .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue looking into the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a mul@@ tic@@ entr@@ e study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great po@@ sterity in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clari@@ fied in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this point I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my bud@@ ding friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ b to a false belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defense @-@ like democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mur@@ mu@@ red , our future ble@@ ak , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize its twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could carry off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in all wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 Bil@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and have absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that , as in an endless loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him if he &apos;s grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances to cause o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my shar@@ per with capitalism --
his most lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to fund especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more importantly and more decisi@@ vely , which gave them the right to political participation with the same voting weigh@@ ting in questions of the public authority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted too long --
like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and dis@@ em@@ powers them .
wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in government today and still not in power because the power from politics to the economy is ander@@ ed and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that have dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on so sustain@@ ably that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics is that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political assets are de@@ valued , the inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy together again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , just as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not seem particularly good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the wa@@ st@@ efulness of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts more deeply like it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democrati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentation .
the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving men and people who are putting their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to another , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and of redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a rising twin summit .
in the area of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and each government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal , in which it prefers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Fr . Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive drop in aggregate demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers refers to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the or@@ ators you clearly stated what you think from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great amount of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , in the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a sense , if I dare say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically speaking .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , huge after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us to say good @-@ bye to ourselves , and the per@@ sever@@ ing denial that a massive ar@@ ming line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which massi@@ vely threatens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal to reveal this denial -
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to den@@ ounce the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions going on through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive dialogue of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they don &apos;t survive , the unle@@ ashed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard of , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ dres@@ ser and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this corner .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have received this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows addic@@ ted , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is more concerned about the average occup@@ ancy , average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon publishes stuff for free , it &apos;s up to you , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you are ski@@ pping or watching again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show you want to produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of staging a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a little frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis breaks out of flu , the bad way , can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data experienced by the most experienced companies , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at work , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what else they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these pieces , put together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will drive it out later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off , making decisions , being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it &apos;s not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you nice .
