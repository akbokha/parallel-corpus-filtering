<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times journalist.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA literally passed Iran blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">The government opposed the Risen government for almost 10 years and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistle-blowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, despite the fact that it was essential for their case for many years, the demands of the government were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and risking to make statements, this could also have his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly concerned his telephone intelligence,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit revenue, and even travel ID with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risky alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more ways to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they receive contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is Securedropping, an open source transmitting system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot procure any more information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to do misdeeds. it's just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abuses in the care of soldiers and who wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who warns the polluted water of Flint. or a wall-street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that kingdoms and powerful] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers come to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mail boxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a 2 billion US dollar bill leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of child days, a famous celist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of an agent's book or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying out from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryozkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those containers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable cuttings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals for how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covered investigator." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years we have seen advances towards more transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "we would really like to see these Panama revelations, this vast insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can finally end the intransparency that now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I once almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale of my own farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy stayed in the red Mazda and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him! he says he would go for peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be kidnapped in the boot of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard to say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "No, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed, sneaked at the toe pointed to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress with.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulled out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something for it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so-called "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham liners tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleus czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite exotic people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can remember the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel - it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we are striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left-seated neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can read not only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in her hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">In this way, most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores Handy now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is canadied for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined with his name; if he had told where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements that all say: "he can really capture very well-unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to reject any negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their ratings before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they relate to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sets out commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make a vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dismiss those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a demand that had not been covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who illegally celebrated parties or apartments ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stay in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project, I worked in the customer service department. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks because of sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">"" "I can only recommend it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now simply call it the" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing will not do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is comparable with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place that one visits a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one in a tavern tour of which one has never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a lead were now offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubators programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone 75,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest in a foreign or even host night.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carousel fitness fanatical,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I wasn't born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oust myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headdress.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you suppressing yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, in comparison to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever have the feeling that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I got married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "I had a child later, after my marriage, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking out."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... Muslim terrorists... "... in the name of Islam..."... "Middle Eastern ancestry..."... "jihad..."...,... "Destruction Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and begin construction studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I felt sweating -- so deep it went down to my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be vigilant" "", "" "" "Be careful" "", "" "" "stay in well lit areas," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings were:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The sentiments were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people that were held for Muslims, crushing into the open and beating.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have received the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays, we can actually hear people saying:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is located as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque causes people to consider other beliefs more tolerant, and show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in Washington, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalization, one has noticed that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from the faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology in their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you take a look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their fury, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the Mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if people present news reports in which it was reported negative about Muslims, they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim lands as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at the mood against Muslims from above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective blame it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when has my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We kept silent with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure at the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled out my shoes, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled people were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brained courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might claim that you're holding a TEDtalk, a mentor with depth, working in a noble think tank, i.e. an exception rather than the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims all over the world, and I did this with the largest study of Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package has penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the public. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in a tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build loadable structures on your own.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be" "" "Start" "" "and" "" "landing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An aircraft that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most Starrflüglers, it can float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the air device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one function.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No folders, hinges and transverse rudder, no more actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move in space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern rigidity. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the bud is an exercise in carelessness, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some of them are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or battery - the machine can fly further, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half of the flight unfit.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">"" "" "" "for guys like us, wages are in development and creativity." ""</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes orbited each other in a very far distant galaxy. they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they shined more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was secreted into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell lives were created on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes reigned through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a crusher in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the wave, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers in courses on relativity theory often lead a really foolish dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and stow, stretch and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stressed when the waves hit. the stretch of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after comma followed by 1. whereupon people declared that the League staff was crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than one thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne posted this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott happily claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create an image or map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">This is different when it comes to sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is interrupting her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, we can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott is busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, straight: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">When the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same chirping with an additional key change. that sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date, which at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo following: [Surrender the noise] No one knows what he needs to hear, acknowledges this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the bars of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to discover the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen however at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the cosmos, but we will never see them, since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt, which we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo it observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaurs for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, on the formation of the stars and ultimately, how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulating of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "yes!" "" "that I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I feared was eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "pussy, I need milk for my bill of beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I would swear to always play with them once you call me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" sagas saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, stir you up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I circled TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment boasts hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days, 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: show To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my television series run one after another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shows that I created myself, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, country or classroom, take me seriously when I speak about work so that you understand that I don't just run around the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am engrossed in my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, one tolerates a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the totals.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totality is action and activity. the totals is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totals are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzzing then you can not strive differently than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not doomed to failure, and I only know that I love the totality.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more broadcasts the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon that I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the totals, the sums, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson states:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My swam was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, reworked weekends, no remorse, no delegate, a Titan sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sump.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hire yourself today, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you do, you are working, one loves to be a teacher, to be a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you a humming when you know the totals, when the humming stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become conscious of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "Schätzchen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzzing buds, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sumo, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet feet, delicate voices, wax pens and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Die Eiskönigin" lets go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity is.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totals, the sums of work, the sum of titanium, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself through broadcasts and television hours and how functioning my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totality is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "I do this as a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic." ""</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I don't have any other choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not as easy to me as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be compared to house?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of these is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We move around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly rigid, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always tell Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teenie's daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>

<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in there!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totality of having a place for peace.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The totals came back in my spare time. the totals then seem to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one impluses an electrode in the brain to influence the neurons "circuits so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior medical doctor and worked day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in case of skull-brain trauma, the brain is swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of the cranial mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of discarding the swollen case of the brain, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a piece of cloth is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may also know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then color them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we redirected it to the receiving point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimplantate the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made a violation and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we colored in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of skill, we injured in the motor cortex the hand motile area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not as precise and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you this was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely will.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue looking into the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism will inevitably lead to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great posterity in Beijing proved without doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clarified in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this point I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my budding friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumb to a false belief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defense-like democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are murmured, our future bleak, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could carry off the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in all wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 Billion US dollars sounds like a lot of money, until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and have absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin tops, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that, as in an endless loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, which could be true that his son would kill him if he's grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances to cause oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharper with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His most lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to fund especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to diminish the value of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that they were involved in the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but more importantly and more decisively, which gave them the right to political participation with the same voting weighting in questions of the public authority.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted too long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually undergoes politics and disempowers them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in government today and still not in power because the power from politics to the economy is andered and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that have decimated the animals they feed on so sustainably that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, the economy that has so far cannibalised politics is that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political assets are devalued, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls, and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and of the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy together again, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, just as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not seem particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the wastefulness of sublime, and the social conflicts more deeply like it -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to restructure the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements he produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in "Matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are serving men and people who are putting their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the "" "" matrix "" "" -like dystopia? "" "</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to another, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and of redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a rising twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and each government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal, in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Fr. Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive drop in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers refers to as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the orators you clearly stated what you think from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great amount of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"" "" "" "as I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, in the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- a fully democratic zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I dare say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically speaking.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, huge after hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard of, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a hairdresser and describes himself on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows addicted, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to sign" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He is more concerned about the average occupancy, average TV -- the shows which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon publishes stuff for free, it's up to you, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you are skipping or watching again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you want to produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it, and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of staging a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a little frightening, because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health Systems company?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the U.S. and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis breaks out of flu, the bad way, can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced by the most experienced companies, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life -- at work, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what else they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these pieces, put together and make a show like "House of Cards," which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will drive it out later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off, making decisions, being an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it's not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you nice.</seg>
