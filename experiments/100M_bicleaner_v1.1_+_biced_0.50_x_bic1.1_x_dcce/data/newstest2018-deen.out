Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an asylum @-@ institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is now excav@@ ated .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that which had to be exciting , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current , but very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and congreg@@ ations have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets , were incorporated into cities and municipalities .
according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since spring 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops arrived at Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ograph@@ ische Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ges@@ blatt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is the send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , there is nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written , numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &apos; original recording &apos; , from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there , but farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the height of &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he forbi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric centers , has been located there since 2006 .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V München east , east of houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architec@@ turally reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 . the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger Street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bombs burst into the inner city .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) main track takes place .
with the slider bar the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel Exp@@ ect@@ ations for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for Far@@ mers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention to travel through the state and to be cau@@ tious , as a number of question@@ able , fast @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes people harder to win discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that dispro@@ por@@ ate minorities , led the group to issue the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US .
the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being charged with crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready whether they bring to purchase money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI , which rank the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration detention , which will contribute to the further benefit of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the CD@@ U member Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac had given themselves a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U local association met together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens supplies and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ eti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
region@@ ales only comes to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental important &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot make profit on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot of things have to be worked with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often in criticism because of the funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of disclosure is 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 Euro , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmer remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß also noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here we produce best food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg offers the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art protection of pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the f@@ enced area must not be tractor @-@ controlled ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
at the moment the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the f@@ isher &apos;s electric fence project in 2018 .
the maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically reduce legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have killed him if he had done it .
but it took its meaning , and in particular the importance attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem about which you refer to was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller lies properly correctly , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falling waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Laz@@ arus also changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writing h@@ ush , R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative act was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp have ever wanted to recognize .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the Team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Power Director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to figure it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ pedi@@ - who compete against Sir M@@ on Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is elected by the team to captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h made quite natural were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete at the 400 @-@ metre barrier at their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year set five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another gam@@ ot that one should observe after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being the special thing about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to go on po@@ di@@ ums .
concerning my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block criticism on Facebook : do not work for a public office if you cannot tolerate the intru@@ sion of voters .
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land as Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ingly democratic state that is ast@@ ounding .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
Law@@ yer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same issue , they are desp@@ ised by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to listen to a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is finishing the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ to had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail @-@ t@@ ach@@ ographs struck on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that Washington made decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ m his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led next door in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he stuck this place .
he is an avi@@ d advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on his home floor .
this event will be the first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how things went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year can be attributed to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
pet inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the v@@ ill@@ inger road is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat at the time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the head of the construction station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground there is a lot of se@@ amounts , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic that obstruc@@ ts construction work is a major problem for st@@ ump@@ p construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts against red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ rich@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called not@@ a - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed up with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is usual here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or right @-@ observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
the journey ent@@ ails a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated iron roofs , which were transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars is estimated at the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars in one officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 souls have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &apos;s were genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are Fac@@ ing Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week events happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources result in an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people struggle to take part here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper than local ones in the traditional market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - cost her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , addressed the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little is changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ rich@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people of Papua , women and children assembled at a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ cks and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - running in a circle and im@@ itating a song of birds - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to smu@@ g@@ gle stones to police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ rich@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly stum@@ bled into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ annes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta the following day .
three weeks later , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Health , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 that he has set up an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto took a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , whom the UN has charged for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted these alleg@@ ations of gri@@ ev@@ ous dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ evic reiter@@ ated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on villa@@ gers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a grand@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ a Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a source of trouble for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the Free Papua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily detained , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty is strengthening dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ z@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of the women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native populations of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived at Nab@@ ire &apos;s airport in larger numbers since the opening of new routes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua have rarely the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ i , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permit to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , Human Rights Watch &apos;s Vice @-@ President , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaig@@ ning to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May , natives broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has won another presidential election in 2019 , but the US states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ i , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like others of Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a final symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday at one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that runs through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down@@ stairs , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units fighting the fire at 4.@@ 00 GMT ( 00 : 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rect questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) was pleased with his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority for this sport .
although they are often very long , but also highly este@@ emed five set classics are preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many demands , the proposal had already been suggested to leave the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find a survey out
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ intentionally prohibited items passing by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled , including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while they accidentally wore illegal knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travelers dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed admitted they unknow@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items dropped by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods were brought about by airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry safety , those who are most often flying .
however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far failed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
apart from the ever @-@ ump@@ tuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less da@@ zzling figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had over 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 USD and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , cleared up Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , Tes@@ la &apos;s boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not the demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 - all models will be combined - 500,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are added per day .
whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines tested never before in practice with maximum capacity .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in flocks .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt is with@@ drawing from the reluct@@ ance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint , which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that ended on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for o@@ zone close to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt told him that he would be delayed for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , had long been a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly resor@@ ted to blocking or dela@@ ying regulation , resist@@ ing the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts Special roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington ruled that the EPA governor exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce Meth@@ ane le@@ aks .
in a statement published Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his face @-@ face at O@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EP@@ O has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then to be accused of being accused of activist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive amend@@ ment to the o@@ zone rules .
the draft legislation approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ as , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered upon P@@ ru@@ anda &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to turn to environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery grounds in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 am invited to a seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius establishment is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors tum@@ ul@@ ting to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg Docum@@ entation : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen including the Vog@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the Mount of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ al Law belonged and not the other way round .
so also people lived there .
as can be seen from the description of the Ober@@ hausen Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , there was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; of the third , the community centre of settlement of the village .
old maps from around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval church right .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , furnished him and occupied with a priest , remained owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two sh@@ red@@ ded at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were cut and the pieces of bell were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was allowed to stand .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 a storm breaks the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned .
only the tower @-@ value existing today remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ y Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn to the Hil@@ arius system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organisers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade at the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler College Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local authorities Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
for the closing of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ es the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ bl@@ ings and audi@@ tors .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini confirms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andrew Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones shall prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had chosen a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a formation mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writings have entered the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the reasoning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ grown households .
the NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s urban coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg region .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ ll Men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the trade association and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the residents to the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will raise the customer sensi@@ ti@@ zing what offers the city &apos;s own city apart from the usual supermarket .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , domestic firms are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
in preparation of commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city are entering another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive Centre . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well as well as selling Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is expected to be new or re @-@ developed .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end everyone should contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly wi@@ dened , King had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time .
apart from Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should adver@@ tise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his or her buying behaviour can influence his / her direct surroundings .

Tru@@ mp placed under pressure after pun@@ ched tran@@ scripts of telephone calls in Mexico due to the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone call with En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , Mexican President , to publicly say he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president ap@@ plau@@ ded him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or to pay Mexico for the project .
the tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade negotiated by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant phone call for the whole day . &quot;
Moore &apos;s Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ act as a call for justice back on
a 1948 @-@ man Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its path .
the captain of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a pin@@ stri@@ pe suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience threw out very real gro@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever tried for the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want justice , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cour@@ tro@@ user puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever tried .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , citizens &apos; rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice in Georgia allowed black citizens to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
at about the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmers , Roger Mal@@ com , stab@@ bed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ ct evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , it will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene conducted the annual post of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivi@@ dly , po@@ ign@@ ant and grounded in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed survey of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the head @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ m , who cries out and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- he , wa@@ ving away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona tells the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ ning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ rup@@ tly and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with mour@@ ning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving lobby of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers swe@@ eps sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is split between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only down the street .
they have experienced all almost eight hours of geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the grave places of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same land where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children sit on their heads , register the bog@@ us blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bled a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw off the ly@@ n@@ ching ropes and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona turns two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the reproduction with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and recalls citizenship rights .
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in certain ways inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner ians in Bayreuth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner along with Mauer@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ sla@@ yer pos@@ ing as a rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold men - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
with Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) dis@@ mis@@ ses a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ fl@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that en@@ circles the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene , when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must also believe .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
a stor@@ my celebration of Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in casual leisure wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 he had to let go of a source of the pipe concert , there were five years later the big jubil@@ ation , in which the occasional &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the public with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of their view .
I draw a positive summary .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go anywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt at the furniture fair , once a week I am staying here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I was working at school already in an open day .
what are your experiences with this ?
lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does this come about ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I knew for myself that it is a wrong thing for me and I want to do something different , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different uses during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from old people &apos;s home to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
different from studying engineering ?
lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating the st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you did not have reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not of the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son cuts 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent since another restructuring programme is being launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job reductions , Director General John Fall@@ on overwhel@@ m@@ ingly announced at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to € 2.@@ 05 billion in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , officials said .
five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured , shared a declaration of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement says that all injured persons are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in the past few weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA convert decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive forward the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Regulation 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; saying that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to rec@@ laim a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the demo@@ crats and nature groups who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gemein@@ der@@ at wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two votes , the Municipal Council decided to establish a joint room in the future retirement home .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the sales contract for the remaining part of the property was signed , reported Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a long time before the church community has been occupied by the church community , there is now no planning obstacle to the project that comes from a private investor .
there is a discussion regarding a common space .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council are ho@@ vering in order not to fores@@ ee such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a shared space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect you do not want to throw a stick between the legs , the statement that both the saddle and the surrounding buil@@ du@@ p - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the tur@@ mo@@ il height and makes building more economical - would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this addition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
not that easy it is in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not move forward so right now , for that one now lean in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common area - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no surplus , but gives a real counterpart , in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s application to ple@@ ad the proposal has three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ arises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step to close a gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown onto road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police communicated , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from 12.@@ 20 am with his bike on the bike trail of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the Senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , however , he apparently did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch car .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven pros are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
personnel recru@@ its at the German Football World Cup in Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 PM / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at the Cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also ren@@ ounce the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
also missing are Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six reviews , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to emerge in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommod@@ ates the need for information of many visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acc@@ es@@ sible Install@@ ations at five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception will play a role in the choice of location choice .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the star path is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why one star more lumin@@ aire than another , although it was essentially farther away .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
the location in the middle of the National Park resin ranges from the Federal Office for Natural Protection to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail in the University of Göttingen on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads with its stel@@ ae up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to D@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth thus shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 metres away , which measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans therefore are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next star , however , would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a potential show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oning world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
as the couple pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia recalled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ x &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound de@@ but@@ s this year to agree with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed himself openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held in with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side see &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ on@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after a tire bur@@ zer
an accident on the A@@ 7 injured four people on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira , shortly before the connection point , lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ threw himself and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed north@@ wards for about one hour , then traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , wouldn &apos;t have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a breach , the For@@ tun@@ en do not want to catch up any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no one else alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I still don &apos;t know how we will act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just got in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ aan and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequis@@ ites are , but that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in the structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether one can speak after a draw of a failed start does not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a thunder@@ storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they stand at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una &apos;s interior minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
visitors from Rheinland will be the easier Favor@@ it on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away only because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in just one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as head coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so spark@@ s don &apos;t want to see his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application test published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for the medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ cord ) has started conducting the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Services ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has disp@@ at@@ ched 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over his age .
in May , the agency published 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual due to pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
if we cannot safely say it , we should not pret@@ end if we could , &quot; he said to the Metro .
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on the north side .
this is a border fastening , which is also used as operating distance .
on Friday there will be a bridge cap on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to go .
the special thing about this is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished off .
for the bridges between the building yard and the grass@@ land in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is a traffic light regulated by traffic lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties prefer to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; great election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and known names at the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Be@@ atri@@ x of Stor@@ k .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well place , but now takes place on the parking under the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence , above all , at the train station , which is just a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it stays peaceful . &quot;
this is what it does : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle a variety of speakers , including the Rhin@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the candidates for the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Be@@ atri@@ x of Stor@@ k to talk about their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series of Has@@ lach &apos;s mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the convent church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have scored solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
such is Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both combine the desire not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach appeals to the two as well as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart was completely open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately ended bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is assured of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was deeply in love with everyone I have taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten said she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I never confused or im@@ pe@@ de myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially suffered , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
08.@@ 11.@@ 2015 &#124; Des@@ per@@ ate Hou@@ se@@ wives
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt offen@@ ded , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some describe me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening in a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of reflections ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; he added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously promised a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice didn &apos;t appro@@ ve H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the Party of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were stra@@ pped away at competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of prohibition , which was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that start on Friday in London based on the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers &quot; mour@@ ning ceremony for Mali
during a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Frit@@ z@@ lar around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ resolved issue of crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the German Armed Forces in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the German army and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German Armed Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ning @-@ branches laid down the rose , the relatives were on the arm in the arm of the coff@@ ers .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and emp@@ tied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operations of the military helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
even Volker Bau@@ ers@@ aft , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubt at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : the deployment is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any details .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that was the case for the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and also referred to the title of &quot; Pr@@ inc@@ mahl . &quot;
because Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the manager of the Danish royal house , declared .
the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the past 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always flo@@ under@@ ing , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sw@@ amps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , she spoke out for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Gre@@ ens MP from her State Parliament fraction in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
group leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to include them .
with that CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Saxon Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l is absolutely essential that the Parliament decides to resolve its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also provides the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament with@@ draws the trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be checked legally clean , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all the questions if they are legally vali@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ we@@ ens &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called herself a de@@ vot@@ ee of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the dep@@ rec@@ y dep@@ uties to return their state parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they will return their country of land , which they have received over the green land list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have deliberately decided not to speak any foreign language in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of El@@ ke T@@ ests in Lower Saxony as a treas@@ on to the CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also treas@@ on to red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Austrian Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the Australia exit costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their deterior@@ ating vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty insi@@ dious game and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Labour MEP Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MPs to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 country election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was at the time strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in parliament .

affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , what we currently know is practically impossible for health hazards .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has come up without delay and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
the trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are accessible and harmless to health .
if the return @-@ highest level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not accessible .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the farms are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they have to face economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service providers .
as always , there is too little control in the case of harvest .
is there a lack of personal or conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be present are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to use only safe and transpor@@ table food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pan@@ elling means manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts will be clari@@ fied spe@@ edi@@ ly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban the teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can safely make the money loose , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar will sign and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they must be subject to legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their business related to football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin when banks or owners drew back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to stop sc@@ aring excessive expenses .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Ne@@ ym@@ ar buy @-@ out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of US sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their earnings by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was charged by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come about payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar WM Ambassador will become and such a maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to comply with any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following the signature .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations from La Liga to a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different paths or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the close cooperation is at a potential end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed the report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the news agency s@@ da on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
each year , approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged chocolate bars distribute the flight atten@@ dant before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
the sector insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious contract for a chocolate manufacturer .
the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
chocolate tables distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss terminated a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the clients of First Class are spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in business class nas@@ chen passengers sch@@ og@@ gi from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class , is also on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the vision@@ aries David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking less vegetable written by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
paying attention to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who grow up - still creating the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character strikes through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the like@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy guy called Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ praised impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ age of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of coinci@@ dental ma@@ dness that could inc@@ ul@@ cate this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile looks at another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his east @-@ east@@ ward I@@ con@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy , created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , gives a TV show to Rh@@ ys Thomas : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , athei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic is@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tags to see ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so deeply involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who plays a Re@@ agan @-@ mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist public is that the Western culture can make everything possible for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian makers were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police is a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts were already issued against them .
the officials also ensured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested in Italy during the same time of ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
an Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ator involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of crimin@@ ality , violent acts , criminal murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Kon@@ stanz against the organized drug trade in southern Germany .
between the attor@@ neys in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Criminal Division of Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian citizens with close links to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise pos@@ ing large gaps in the for@@ eigner property
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a large number of gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Registry , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be administered by approximately 600 ali@@ ens polic@@ y@@ makers in Germany .
because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defective data inputs can slow reverse processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on out@@ going people there are also EU citizens who would not have to travel abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but these false al@@ ign@@ ments led to a distorted debate on dealing with out@@ casts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending refugees back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office on Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it says that BA@@ MF is introducing such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin deal is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now states : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments sufficiently .
other EU states would also send back refugees back in the scope of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful conditions of reception and a threat to child welfare because of the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best@@ est result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who meanwhile donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , the church hon@@ ours multiple eag@@ ern@@ ess to don@@ ate blood in the assembly of the council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned food is broken down into its constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions taken in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the shift to the theatre house few years ago led to higher number of participants .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple donations and awarded 50 donated blood donations .
half as many Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger book , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter sold 500 milli@@ litres per 500 milli@@ liter each .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members expected to increase in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alised that in the coming years interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a portion of the mamm@@ oth business package which was issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for finance to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the next February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion in ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the GDP ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term since the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates she repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would require inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mentally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are projected to rise by 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these news as against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rate of interest and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes even worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; income tax , but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to recover at the end of their three @-@ year prog@@ nosis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes one year after the fall of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the Fund .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
the Bank said that over@@ write in relation to its goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and would like to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those with existing deals and new mort@@ g@@ ages ending , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should fund him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be launched in UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to appro@@ ve the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is sold £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement procedure .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ p , if targeted towards needy and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ian Green , CEO of the Ter@@ rence Hig@@ gins Trust : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been acquired , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ atively this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ alter@@ ing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the cess@@ ation of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , recovered from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne st@@ ow@@ age space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us copper light window looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends in order to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the bri@@ st@@ les and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important , so when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t fall in the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from some standard into something quite amazing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate companies in Victori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler apartments and shopping centres in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as the &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court &apos;s first hearing was held .
the Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business , including Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have ruled out .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , where Col@@ in opened the first shop of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and $ 26 million in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in kept back very cau@@ ti@@ ously , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
Col@@ in replied by SMS , to say &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to finish in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the president .
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television lasts decades back - and now , where he is in the White House his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politicians Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the tru@@ mp habit under control , according to six former election campaign officers , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Twitter habit ever was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officers know something we don &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would not have included any more ignition material without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp Control .
part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advis@@ ors to give the president without question@@ able information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone was vi@@ cious to the President a printed copy of an article of Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief secretary K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

travellers bar@@ gain over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire row &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on the foot of war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they had only been thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be obliged by Sch@@ am to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers stayed there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of those travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with Soli@@ hul@@ ls police . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ k@@ enhof will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
this is good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through its former ambience operating company l@@ t@@ d. as of April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers through the establishment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed in the public at that time .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Executive Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction waste containers have been in front of the entrance for some time now , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread broad@@ ly , explains she@@ ers further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he had talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and the director of the tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
according to the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly .
just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is built , which will be accessible by the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special En@@ voy sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the affair .
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ cast@@ ers reported that there were already the first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have purpos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller was investigating whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ative focus is on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign .
report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment .
the &quot; Washington Post , &quot; a few weeks ago , wrote that the Sonder@@ kommand@@ o Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the centre and under@@ mined the accus@@ ation whether the President might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ciary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to apply for prosecution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Grand Jury are also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indic@@ t@@ lements &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly it is switched on when it concerns larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge individuals under oath .
according to the CN@@ N station , charges have already been issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also at the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension showed that Mu@@ eller would not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in order to decide about the charging of an accus@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the new revelations , the President took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else about which they can speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that expe@@ dite the work of the Special Agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not determined against the President .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the statement .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this reputation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ciary .
in June , Com@@ ey testified before a Senate committee , asking Tru@@ mp for a setting up of the investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees .
this prov@@ oked spec@@ ulations about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair for the later @-@ coming President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the president &apos;s margins .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft law@@ suits on Thursday after which the Special Off@@ er could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been replaced by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the giant col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research indications .
however , for about 30 years , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now collap@@ sed col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaciers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
just north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking had been disturbed a few years ago .
a complete Shel@@ f is dis@@ integrating there , writes A@@ WI research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f file is in danger , because the front edge has never gone as far as currently .
in addition , the ic@@ e@@ plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key location .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could increase sea level eventually , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and that we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice label now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wil@@ dest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f will grow back or come back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not bring back the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ co@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature increases .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus count towards the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , the circle of the circle has sha@@ ken 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the seats that were to be posted this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
according to the parties &apos; wishes , the administration is said to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for professionals , but also to counter@@ act future @-@ oriented candidate scar@@ city .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete action for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adver@@ tise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry due to illness or age due to age .
it is high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the common application with his party .
he already made a big surprise already in the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous day when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and was stun@@ ned by the remaining parties .
people want all the possibilities to be verified that allow a discharge from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a ho@@ of @-@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and function@@ aries than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ffs for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO Mig@@ rants &quot; b@@ ail@@ out boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organization &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year now , refused to express itself in detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; boat , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes hos@@ ti@@ lities on board , which will be delivered directly from the traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was said to have occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Office of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of sus@@ pending the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all , must have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the Code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
lookout points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer climbs , for which long tri@@ als were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim for Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ ages market .
again there was a lookout spot at the lookout , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ ject huts brought a welcome break .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neustadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps for e @-@ sport
do the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being swe@@ at@@ y by wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high guests included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still many clubs climbing this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London will organize the first Interactive Club World Cup , where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , it is possible to be present online much more often in these markets than to send the federal lig@@ aments to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup , will be scre@@ ened on a competition level .
as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a right kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to the things that are getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ats also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in the classic sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also takes cogni@@ tion , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming a topic more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no inter @-@ cultural barriers .
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to lie at 130 million euros .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the road .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there are a lot of things happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ ats .
in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company in the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to the fact that only football stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter j@@ ailed for the text by Conrad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June of a casual murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my son was my best friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
she was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointed eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ r &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they absolutely regret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity for his sisters , &quot; it says .
Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the realization that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this single person with whom I was together since I was born every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge others to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew attention to national attention after Car@@ ters disclosed text messages that she encouraged him to quit his life .
&quot; hang you up , spring from a building , stand up for yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinions .
one of the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder by her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter is deser@@ ving of compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of the FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern pl@@ ung@@ es a great season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the rush to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bayern Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f who had arrived from youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just out of the holiday , but he .
you prefer to distribute sugar@@ s to those you like to keep in mood .
those who were chosen to compete with L@@ ame &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ ushed over the field as a mini @-@ lear@@ ner .
at the right back , that &apos;s his position , the white binder on his arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ ber@@ ly worked in this starting @-@ formation like the one who can take the helm as well .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal tried to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely folds ) ; Ren@@ ato san@@ ches with the devil come out on the achievements of the Asia journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance at Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked fine .
Sü@@ le ran apart from Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times successfully in the building .
his colleague Ru@@ dy indeed admitted that the result was &quot; not the way we &apos;d been hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , tempo song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection with the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba thinks of the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller registered on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies all the best .
the Bavarian Legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club @-@ colleague from Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian Football Champion of the Year and Champions League winners should be a special motivation for motivation .
the famous Bayern Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ la pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still was Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ Request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy that has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top in the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is supposed to be the construction law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Office plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to put the course into operation in December 2020 , says Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier looks in the new master &apos;s bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a bonus of 1000 euros is provided for the passed master test and 2500 euros , if graduates within ten years after the master training make their own .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time lacks the land at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the I@@ HK Trier .
a total of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility have so far been occupying 29 jobs .
the I@@ HK is calling for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
the CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country &apos;s investment in 2017 and 2018 more than € 20 million less in the preservation of country roads than suggested .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us expects a concept of the country as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
further , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK pol@@ l only with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreement .
Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW @-@ chairman said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
neither of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles , also increases , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of depri@@ ving the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could severely affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen &apos;s profit dispro@@ portion@@ ately .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach Bridge .
and that is not a normal raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the Construction Bureau wants to clear up .
on the raft one sees a big information @-@ saving .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; shall shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a sensitive game of game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and this year too , there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the laughter against the suffering &quot; &quot; &quot;
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the ni@@ ches of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he , among other things , suggested himself as a carto@@ onist for greetings cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris he made a breakthrough at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found a lot of fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ bles in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his testimony , he still sits at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find its dro@@ id figures worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand foot@@ er as a counterpart .
in 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather focuses on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and due to the diseases transmitted by scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .
this has impacts on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf @-@ goat broad@@ casts , and in very dry weather there are very many of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials , and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are at least seven dead in seven countries following attacks and threats .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ ama ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a public prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is more tra@@ itors .
without information about the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ sius in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story mos@@ ques for drug kings who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ sius , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ yan Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , prospective gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was not forcing Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for North America in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to create Ri@@ odo@@ sius and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for dish@@ ear@@ tening and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ sius she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it was leading .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the odo@@ sius team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and stay there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret starting and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the odo@@ sius Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is done with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling gro@@ o@@ ves , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were mand@@ ated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sius in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters wondered if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen that the governor didn &apos;t call trusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters entered the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are actually under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sius made three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated in the home town of the governor .
and there was a group that carried out a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , belonging to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all political planes .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was turned into a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few notes and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it &apos;s his .
in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organized protests and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth .
she has since asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an equivalent society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the last year , the media watch@@ dog group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accounted for more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug trade start@@ led him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I was re@@ porters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with her@@ ni@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ b@@ stone &apos;s edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stood close by - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who stood guard to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sius followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think of closing it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period from 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossi@@ ls of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tw@@ inkl@@ ing a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has been sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably has been threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to ming@@ le better with his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marker mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team having spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of sheds and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were driven from enough pressure by eating meat e@@ aters , that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his saved Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and pushed into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served fla@@ ky skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost feel that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the world &apos;s best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the sub@@ marine of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hoods cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ to &apos; .
the more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the sheds on his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass incar@@ cer@@ ation on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass incar@@ cer@@ ation .
there are numerous wounded , miles long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass incar@@ cer@@ ation .
according to the police , there were almost 30 vehicles between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including trucks .
there is no information about the exact number of injured persons .
it was a mild to moderate injury , said a police spokesman .
a wide range of ambul@@ ance vehicles was part of the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , there was a round ten @-@ kilometre back @-@ sta@@ u .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , there was also a counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the vehicle &apos;s license plates , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive fin@@ es .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : you &apos;re sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ening into his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one uns@@ crew or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the or@@ tless ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run is underway on two lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railroad speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the card de@@ valuation without conductor .
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : a smartphone or tablet is required .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
you also have to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most comfortable type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; functions as follows : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for electronic validation .
the train atten@@ dant will receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and took the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant is at number Y at ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can go on sleeping , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , you simply check yourself in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case one of the fellow travelers , do not have all the documents you need to de@@ valu@@ ate online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the evenings or big room and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just the connection between ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other numbers on the same track are not yet enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat that rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an eighte@@ en @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ eter the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and of a man who claimed to be father &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman backed his gun and scre@@ amed : &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel and F@@ erg@@ uson , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance stem@@ ming from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand responses .
when Fer@@ rel came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two spoke a conversation they had seen countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them with them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience , where she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the potential non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question came to Fer@@ rel : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson have not centered , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his involvement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following the shooting of Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portrayed , for this is how I will be portrayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we constantly fight on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sive type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sha@@ ken this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves the issue cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is also discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping for almost a week in the farmers market hall for many years now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers gladly again very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
there are also other cities in other cities .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are the top boxes in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive at the top .
as you can see , retail shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall take place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes sometime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the spec@@ ter bit gallery before selling all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping centre that stands empty doesn &apos;t need anybody .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane of many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg have no place any more .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being publicly classified diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called &quot; A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance . &quot;
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ alpine and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal bridges , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a cartoon illustr@@ ated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president of the law would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also a little deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is a mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ lö@@ f hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully be taken with is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video plant from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she comes up with a free @-@ talk tel@@ eph@@ on in the hand from the disciplinary team of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they let your speech be cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ utes from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras , which unite like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also purpos@@ eful , as everything was in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford in search of killing
a national treasure hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford University staff who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder , due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as showing the acts of the County Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the Police Office of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the action , and det@@ ectives investigating the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them is an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an email explaining that La@@ them had now been left in a absence and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal off@@ ence examined by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email explaining that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a potential domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to ensure compliance with code that describes the criteria for R@@ US@@ A@@ DA res@@ etting and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of dop@@ ing approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ enko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian point of sale at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov reported problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody pre@@ tends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing scandal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being

it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be further assumed by any health impair@@ ment , stated in the communication .
from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ be@@ zz@@ em@@ itt@@ el .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ veys and Sur@@ veys from specific teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which executives have low approval results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ ve why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , following the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alle in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converting has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
it has recently been registered as a client .
as G@@ LIN@@ T , converting company lets you send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and if the major managing director is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ gence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 sites , has invested in more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and in@@ convenient experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Conver@@ gence , problems that were previously identified by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began taking Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Conver@@ cent provide their software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February Conver@@ gence received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising its total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ y secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and invested its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their workplaces than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you spend your time with a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard , and that the work you do is more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no measures .
in fact , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments and employees can dem@@ oti@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have too much reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets more and more insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players chat on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show off their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons carried out practical exercises .
20 years before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he support the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continued to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been disc@@ arded with foot@@ balls that clean up a protective net behind a gate pole , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting out to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors from third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the Company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors who may display the results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for which social media networks should be punished if they do not succeed to quickly eradic@@ ate hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts check was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories from third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic book : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says with one accord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Swi@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted to the print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , which worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell in smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome pit a little &quot; ) it seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to look through the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena @-@ heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape designers , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only granted full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who had what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
guys , let all go their gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are connected to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the lords seemed to be quite che@@ ek@@ y , making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men sol@@ der their school crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adver@@ tise land@@ ings . &quot;
after the end of his involvement in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the covering of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret by the mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think of that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes on her website which she wrote yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to win your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer &apos;s citizens we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the promotion , more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ fifth @-@ digit figure for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ing and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as before , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s office .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the consultations .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government dra@@ gs the re@@ ins in the army .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the forces of the air forces and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als in 16@@ 9 .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara for this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash test as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; god@@ send &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the repe@@ al of the ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the army and security forces continue to work .
in mid @-@ July , by decree , Erdo@@ gan fired further 73@@ 95 prosec@@ ut@@ ors , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier considered to be the real masters of the country .
three times they dominated their role as the guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the military power step by step , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is pushing forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not allow Nato to get cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington will change the Green Card rules
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , &quot; said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he fores@@ ees the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spending Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to upgrade route for race @-@ race shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months , the future of the race @-@ off sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go very fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mar@@ o@@ des track &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which the tourist railway goes , is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the race , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair was reduced to around 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country will exceed 75 percent .
the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future by the country , will be finally agreed , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
in this way , the race @-@ gate shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is being used by many people in order to order it regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the ascen@@ sion of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it will still be more wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ per @-@ woman progres@@ sively look .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
this Robot Part can be added to a K@@ ill@@ stre@@ ak Fabri@@ c@@ ator in creation of a K@@ ill@@ stre@@ ak Kit .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold@@ sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is said here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah to rest@@ less one the most .
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy has a vibr@@ ator on its website , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
their development and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not stick to sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the marginal zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most app@@ alling aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the sophisticated eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 phrase : ma@@ ids
Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a certainty of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp choosing relatives .
we all o@@ sten@@ si@@ bly ex@@ ert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a le@@ ft@@ ward bree@@ der who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom it had fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side .
the dining table is certainly a good thing , but in a wider context it seems to me that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild crime .
when Tru@@ mp is concerned , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ perc@@ ei@@ ving music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is in fact not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counted - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have rated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic , while tired of having the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to the hospital .
last year , he was taken to hospital due to the treatment of cuts on his wrist victims , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 , shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he was holding his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence by Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Agency said that it would raise obj@@ ections to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Flo@@ wers schools , the four @-@ party benef@@ ici@@ aries from F@@ ats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were vac@@ ated during the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the school@@ children will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle who grows in the chicken yard , but is released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led to a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it bro@@ iled from his chickens .
instead of a hen @-@ k@@ ens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in studying Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ dd@@ les who bore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ eller to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a word of appreciation to colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps in teaching passes , and the par@@ ental representatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kü@@ ken@@ zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is now over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after two years of teaching , she would leave her students very reluct@@ ant , because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ colour z@@ äss@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end all students left a song of summer and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out with the children .
for the new school year , eight first @-@ runners are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of criminals were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs B@@ TV reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are supposed to improve the emission characteristics of cars from the E@@ missions classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ ering from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power @-@ drive Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation over the next few months but have not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its scope .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE starts to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ ronic .
does a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel so far .
the ACE is advised to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows therefore already announced to ren@@ ounce the participation at the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp for clari@@ fying her point of view .
the Kennedy Center named after former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun , as he communic@@ ates in the press talk .
he tells of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it surprised him that no application has so far been fulfilling the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time to famili@@ ari@@ ze itself with the regular periods of notice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lower Construction Authority &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the applicant must present appropriate degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could no longer fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the clos@@ eness between the city and the city itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the field of h@@ ack@@ ers with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction department and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dutch parking lot have been initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kin@@ zig@@ tal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great scope for a city builder .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the arrangement of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going town master emphasizes .
in any case , the city builder is responsible for high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further shaping of the city .
those who would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed study of the city of Has@@ lach as a diploma engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the field of civil engineering and planning law .
the municipal building department is subject to high and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ mining facilities , municipal property management , municipal yard with construction yard and municipal landscap@@ ing as well as underground building rights authorities , including historic monuments .
bicycles are thrown on lines : south run@@ way closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them for the night .
near the crime scene witnessed a rose sco@@ oter and a bicycle rac@@ er witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lausanne region , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have put himself in great danger himself and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the facility , as well as the delay of the delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic , the don@@ ors of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south run@@ way could be led without disabilities .
almost ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of them covered the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains failed , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products might ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the inc@@ urable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .
while the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to detect a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet of more toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus in Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system works in people .
post @-@ doctoral research Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan was investigating a kind of immune cell that fav@@ oured tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately housed , did not have this .
they assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ biot@@ ics of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but were missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i had grown in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the intoler@@ ance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active ingredient was puri@@ fied of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as an In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han hal@@ ved hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant producing cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect us in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ z@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but M@@ atic had been excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u were also in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho announced his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the airplane manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing has had such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Bunker Adju@@ st@@ ment Factor for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .
only no bon@@ fire from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the League , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House are monitoring the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has been receiving from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep hits .
and one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not be ruled out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green MPs has thrown the government of prime minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the dissi@@ dent Dutch Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return to their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Elec@@ toral Commission Leader of the Green Publishing Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ ghs when the new hi@@ jac@@ king message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition from the green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the provisional climax of a series of large and small crises in SPD national associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ sa began with an un@@ expectedly strong defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ ass@@ ented themselves .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was the case - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a swing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smoothly .
the comrades in the weeks afterwards strug@@ gled again .
then , when they had just taken new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was reached by Hamburg .
and with him came the next stroke .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made pretty much everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been critic@@ ised for a long time .
mi@@ ese det@@ en@@ tions were added .
nevertheless , or maybe that &apos;s why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l has been trying to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they allowed him to grant him a stabil@@ isation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is no blame on the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
the comrades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the back@@ sliding Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the country list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens in Parliament , leaving Lower Saxony representatives further .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate &apos;s consent four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads Lower Saxony &apos;s SPD as a leading candidate into the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
subsi@@ dy funds for local nucleus III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Stadt@@ entwicklung on Wednesday received sen@@ timent .
at the beginning of the informative event Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been in sensitive areas of rehabilitation .
at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - in the end , it is important to also promote the interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe receives the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euro , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the congregation sensation .
what is the result of a rehabilitation area ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in rehabil@@ itating if there is interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the area borders could be postpon@@ ed again .
the jet@@ ty represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the content of the federal states program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set as a constitution .
the approval period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey would only take place , as part of those participating in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the aim of the sentence is to take place as far as possible , so that the remedi@@ ation can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that any Commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
the aim is to assess and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ interpretation of the land register .
once again Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to his senses and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ lieb pointed out that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the rehabilitation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphasized that the distribution of the funding according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - whoever comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there could be no subsidies for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local nucleus II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the atten@@ de@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor releases himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that produces the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the information provided by the military who were left to TI@@ ME Magazine to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , vice @-@ president Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited next to a yacht in Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ man and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft .
the Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the chron@@ icle of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of the aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news was shown that the helicopter arrived at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn in the morning , and until the law@@ ns were left between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure flight from the White House was delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain government regulations .
the use of aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo op is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp was conducting an investigation when the presi@@ dency aircraft operated against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn region to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget terms for the presi@@ dency flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the United States Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement values is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke of Sik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representatives and was jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
&quot; &quot; &quot; top riders of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second Tennis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ liga compete in the Tab@@ ellen@@ verzeichnis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ V &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ verzeichnis Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the fact that there is still a flaw@@ less balance after five games , the leading runner of the Second Tennis division has maintained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the back positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assignments in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is still difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north stands in a practical way .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ chman did not compete in the league matches at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the competition in the Czech liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) will be his first bet this season .
the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo featured yesterday with the White @-@ Russian An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P @-@ Tournam@@ ent in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the Ball .
he should be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again come back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer fills the cad@@ re at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he placed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to intensi@@ fy the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress wrapped up a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ stered the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors in O@@ MV have been troubled , which together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ eh@@ isse is huge .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp himself would have to raise the sanctions even per executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at what the Group could defend and which could hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city is organising the lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a allocation to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the watch is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Services , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer is responsible for this task and delivers freshly cooked dishes .
the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld district , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ ten year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours are eaten in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour support when children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen services as of September 1 : they heat up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , divide the meal individually , leave out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are firmly assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven group units - decides about the volume of hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children are supposed to help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaning@@ fully .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleansing of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economically efficient in comparison with the cost comparison between self @-@ storage and foreign lending for the city .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Vice @-@ President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be deployed in the coun@@ ties in the provinces . three women are campaig@@ ning for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democrati@@ cally elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ som , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3,@@ 6 million votes .

according to the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl on the phone .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tia factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow by managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory producing other products such as Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said that over the last few years he has invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tia called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressing concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross are deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce is focusing heavily on the local community and the Glasgow large room , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Pla@@ dis : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ eiter has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually review our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full and completely . if our operating procedures change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may interest her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t give up in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season .
after finishing Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paying professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ .000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board is insi@@ sting that the club has always tried its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the soccer world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report about the ab@@ uses is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; said after publication in front of the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the retired Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , according to the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a bon@@ ded fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows have been a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
in a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; were victims of ass@@ aults , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , said : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to many other def@@ endants , many victims have estimated that many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , can even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against the victims of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ er@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became tangible to the Ö@@ f@@ teren when a cathedral @-@ spar@@ row musically offered no top performance .
how can you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems to be in it at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or involvement in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside his sphere of influence .
you can throw it at best , get out of it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which he worked was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , also portra@@ y him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes from children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also gave ear @-@ che@@ eks to the hair or ears , he even admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
it must be noted , however , that such educational methods were widely used in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what actually is going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , Bag@@ at@@ ella is admitt@@ edly a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt about the fact that many media have just stepped on it with its famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many who never understood him still work di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported about the abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also responsible for any involvement or co @-@ existence with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted to the master of the domain .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who professionally would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioning student wrote : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ying more intru@@ sive or clearer or more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , legitimate teachers etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that students and / or their environment affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to acqu@@ it anyone .
thus it cannot be repro@@ ached for not being prevented or brought to display .
therefore there is no reason to get in touch with these vile crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge p@@ lier of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly what abuse of the report is .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and painted and suffered , all of them acquired at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have reigned .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most of the witnesses stressed , the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this applies equally to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the primary school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger read the ears consistently before the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the punishment will continue to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clear@@ ness was , when test sentences were also banned in Bavaria for a long time .
in front of it they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows still knows .
it was difficult for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers might have exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where the allow@@ able limit had really been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked out .
that just doesn &apos;t work .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated that it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ ares of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of assessing the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ inable at all times , and not for what was broken at the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to innocent child souls , that goes far beyond the customary exercise .
this is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , in other words , to pull the ears and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his time in Regensburg has taken Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; did the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test punishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also come to the language ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective , and the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen also played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not at all refuse to have a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this must also be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and candy alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys will once not make a great singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming of self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamentally ben@@ evol@@ ent , deeply believing and hear@@ tless people , from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something just a fly .
I regularly get along with , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , regularly visit him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not yet for@@ given him that he once was stern to them , therefore , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ans are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and bringing them the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to whom she still looks and whom she down@@ right ad@@ ores .
and please , again quite clearly : all you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most unfair to make a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intention behind it .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it .
now the starting point , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its , and without which nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen at last , would finally be in peace .
