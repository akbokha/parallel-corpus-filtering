<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An asylum-institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where the S-Bahn tunnel is now excavated.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that which had to be exciting, because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current, but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and congregations have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called urine sheets, were incorporated into cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since spring 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops arrived at Lunéville's peace on February 9, 1801, they were the neighbours of today who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria board.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographische Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "the" "" "Urgesblatt" "" "for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is the sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, there is nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written, numbered pieces from the so-called 'original recording', from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there, but farmers of the plant" "" "land in sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height of "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based Kreis-Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "arose." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not suffice - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric centers, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV München east, east of houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in an architecturally reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as the" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856. the" "" "Kaufinger Street" "" "was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombs burst into the inner city.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn (S-Bahn) main track takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider bar the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel Expectations for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for Farmers" "" "has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to be cautious, as a number of questionable, fast-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," "" "it says in the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes people harder to win discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that disproporate minorities, led the group to issue the warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from Missouri's Attorney General, showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready whether they bring to purchase money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI, which rank the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration detention, which will contribute to the further benefit of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher Hof" "" "project is a successful project and will continue next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">Members of the CDU member Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac had given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fisherman's CDU local association met together with the mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens supplies and accommodated in five apartments Feriengeti.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest Milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionales only comes to the table of the Feriengeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "fundamental important" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot make profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot of things have to be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not lead a bio-plant.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often in criticism because of the funding." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 Euro, half of the leaders were promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you're doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß also noted:" "" "here we produce best food." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg offers the state-of-the-art protection of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area must not be tractor-controlled (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">At the moment the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the fisher's electric fence project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area is equivalent to 35 hectares, and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have killed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its meaning, and in particular the importance attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem about which you refer to was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies properly correctly, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "falling waste" "" "on our screens was better seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus also changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writing hush, Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one drawer, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often awful voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump have ever wanted to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="151">"being the special thing about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>

<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland as Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>

<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>

<seg id="423">Apart from the ever-umptuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has revealed another, less dazzling figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly report: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>

<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>

<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not the demand but on the production side.</seg>

<seg id="432">In 2018 - all models will be combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are added per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Whoever orders a "Model 3" today must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines tested never before in practice with maximum capacity.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA leader Pruitt is withdrawing from the reluctance of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint, which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period that ended on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ozone close to bottom." ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, had long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulation, resisting the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts Special rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA governor exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce Methane leaks.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then to be accused of being accused of activist groups and others," "" "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive amendment to the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">The draft legislation approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 am invited to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius establishment is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and sponsors tumulting to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Wuerttemberg Documentation: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen including the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Mount of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the Church or the Patronal Law belonged and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So also people lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As can be seen from the description of the Oberhausen Freudenstadt from 1858, there was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Mountain" of the third, the community centre of settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval church right.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished him and occupied with a priest, remained owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two shredded at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were cut and the pieces of bell were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was allowed to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834 a storm breaks the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-value existing today remained as a witness to the 750 year old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"" "today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the" "" "Schaffy Rentals" "" "as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius system." ""</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery in St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler College Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local authorities Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 15.30.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the closing of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "organises the fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of importance for tumblings and auditors.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlingens are particularly committed to their home care as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.</seg>

<seg id="508">The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone exists at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-grown households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's urban councillor gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg region.</seg>

<seg id="681">Max amount works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where to go anywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt at the furniture fair, once a week I am staying here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I was working at school already in an open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with this?</seg>
<seg id="687">Lot: it's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does this come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Quantity: I did Abitur.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I knew for myself that it is a wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, working with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what do you do.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, in the focal point maybe, really is.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Quantity: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in social affairs in the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="702">It always depends where you make your FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">You can do it from old people's home to youth work - in all kinds of facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon supervision.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out.</seg>
<seg id="708">Different from studying engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Lot: well, here it's not about calculating the statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">There are always other people who have a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a teenager, who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you did not have reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: for this I am not of the type.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Lots of love, great kindness.</seg>

<seg id="889">"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "may be under 18 years old" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "he said to the magazine The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of the medical age assessment, where X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual due to puberty.</seg>

<seg id="904">Works on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a concrete part of the bridge was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitated bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has meanwhile come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning has a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastening, which is also used as operating distance.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday there will be a bridge cap on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is supposed to go.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is about finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish first had to be fished off.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the grassland in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is a traffic light regulated by traffic lights.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties prefer to pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat.</seg>

<seg id="947">This is what it does: around 8pm there is a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle a variety of speakers, including the Rhineinland pfälzische AfD-Chairperson Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the candidates for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Stork to talk about their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD-event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 o'clock.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenses of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban the teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG eventually has to prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose, so that Neymar will sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"" "" "" "clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be subject to legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break-even point in their business related to football." ""</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin when banks or owners drew back their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to stop scaring excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of US sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their earnings by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catastrophic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was charged by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar WM Ambassador will become and such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG would mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to comply with any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent neymars away by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, recovered from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne stowage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlap so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends in order to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the bristles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's important, so when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't fall in the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Indeed, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate companies in Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp confrontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate and De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt. Buller apartments and shopping centres in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin is described by Paul as the "principal operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the Supreme Court's first hearing was held.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business, including Colin, as Paul claims to have ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 "s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says he started Westco when he was" "" "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to pass their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi has often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and $26 million in leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul says" "" "about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin kept back very cautiously, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Colin replied by SMS, to say "I can't say much," because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media abstinence of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television lasts decades back - and now, where he is in the White House his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election advisor Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "politicians Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the trump habit under control, according to six former election campaign officers, insists that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit ever was" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officers know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets would not have included any more ignition material without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Control.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the advisors to give the president without questionable information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he can find out where they originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone was vicious to the President a printed copy of an article of Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief secretary Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">This is good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof through its former ambience operating company ltd. as of April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers through the establishment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the public at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Executive Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Envoy sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcasters reported that there were already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us secret services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller was investigating whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigative focus is on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Reportedly, Mueller also scrutinized more and more Trumps private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post," a few weeks ago, wrote that the Sonderkommando Trump has personally moved to the centre and undermined the accusation whether the President might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to apply for prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"" "therefore, Grand Jury are also called" "" "indictlements" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly it is switched on when it concerns larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge individuals under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, charges have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr., Trumps advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam chief Paul Manafort were also at the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the suspension showed that Mueller would not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in order to decide about the charging of an accusation.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, the President took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else about which they can speak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he knew nothing about the suspension of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But they usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses any measures that expedite the work of the Special Agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this reputation, accusations against Trump have been loud, he has hindered the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey testified before a Senate committee, asking Trump for a setting up of the investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This provoked speculations about whether Trump Mueller would be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair for the later-coming President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the president's margins.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The giant colossus, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research indications.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for about 30 years, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now collapsed colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Just north of this horseshoe the balance of waxing and breaking had been disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelf is disintegrating there, writes AWI research scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Shelf file is in danger, because the front edge has never gone as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iceplate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key location.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase sea level eventually, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and that we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice label now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the wildest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, it is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Shelf will grow back or come back in the long term and possibly collapses, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-coves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature increases.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus count towards the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU calls to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, the circle of the circle has shaken 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now, 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were around 620 applications for the seats that were to be posted this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and to oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">According to the parties' wishes, the administration is said to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs for professionals, but also to counteract future-oriented candidate scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete action for newcomers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is from a regular" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry due to illness or age due to age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already made a big surprise already in the Cretaceous day when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and was stunned by the remaining parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be verified that allow a discharge from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-related cities - a hoof-tariff," "" "says Peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">The CDU tries to better pay the employees and functionaries than it actually foresees the tariffs for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which orientates itself in professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Councillor Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO Migrants "bailout boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization "Youth Rettet ', because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year now, refused to express itself in detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being collected after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the 'Youth Rettet' boat, the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew takes hostilities on board, which will be delivered directly from the traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was said to have occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Office of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of suspending the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa, above all, must have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the Code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring about" "" "essential changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants entering Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the Minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "nine Weilermer Bikers, the" "" "Berlin outpost" "" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Lookout points followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim for Saline and the folk festival sausages market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout spot at the lookout, connected by "flowerge" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, many altimeters have been announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inject huts brought a welcome break.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled saline brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being sweaty by wind and weather over stadium racing?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high guests included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "we have also recognized the first Bundesligavereine, which are increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, it is possible to be present online much more often in these markets than to send the federal ligaments to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA World Cup, will be screened on a competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, lilies have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a right kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to the things that are getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobats also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in the classic sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also takes cognition, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capacity.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW-chairman said that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Neither of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers, systems for the neutralization of exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles, also increases, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of depriving the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigation at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could severely affect Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen's profit disproportionately.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in spring brought much less rain and much more in the autumn.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are at least seven dead in seven countries following attacks and threats.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodosius, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice." two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panama ut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a public prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely brought to justice by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is more traitors.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodosius in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mosques for drug kings who are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodosius, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, there was the publication of an interview with Damyan Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, prospective gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North America in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to create Riodosius and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for disheartening and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the founding of Riodosius she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" "" "for her coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The odosius team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curb like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine his calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the odosius Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is done with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling grooves, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were mandated by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodosius in a four-storey building in a mid-range Culiacan area.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were one of the 50 percent of the policemen that the governor didn't call trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are actually under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodosius made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures concentrated in the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, belonging to the reigning Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had seen Valdez's column as the most informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was turned into a storage room for signs and stickers, protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few notes and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it's his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an equivalent society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably has been threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to mingle better with his surroundings and evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurs family made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta marker mitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team having spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of sheds and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs were driven from enough pressure by eating meat eaters, that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous dinosaurs predators must have been the Cretaceous period," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his saved Darminhaltes, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and pushed into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved flaky skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost feel that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the submarine of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hoods cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a win in the lotto '.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, St. Louis Geborene was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb flat that rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>

<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman backed his gun and screamed: "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>

<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrel and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance stemming from the point of view of the people who live in the community and filled the streets to demand responses.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrel came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two spoke a conversation they had seen countless times before this morning "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground when the activists were waiting for the potential non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrel and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>

<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came to Ferrel: "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often from whites - in a community that profited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered, and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferr's's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferr's's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves the issue cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "", "the topic is also discussed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery say: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive at the top.</seg>

<seg id="2124">Matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being publicly classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called "A Becoming resemblance."</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transalpine and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from maning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal bridges, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a cartoon illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president of the law would turn judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also a little deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning called for her oversized signature among them (the "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is a mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Haglöf hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully be taken with is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video plant from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she comes up with a free-talk telephon in the hand from the disciplinary team of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A national treasure hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University staff who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder, due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as showing the acts of the County Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A public warning system published by the Police Office of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the action, and detectives investigating the engravings as murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem is an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice President for University Relations, said in an email explaining that Lathem had now been left in a absence and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them strengthen," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to ensure compliance with code that describes the criteria for RUSADA resetting and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2189">"" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutenko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, leader of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian point of sale at the beginning of the day, Smirnov reported problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>

<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>

<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convergence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 sites, has invested in more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convergence, problems that were previously identified by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent provide their software as a service, and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February Convergence received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzy secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and invested its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their workplaces than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you spend your time with a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices heard, and that the work you do is more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT."

<seg id="2243">Investors reach Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretakers of a company take no measures.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough or not at all, disappointments and employees can demotify.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will still be more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepper-woman progressively look.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">This Robot Part can be added to a Killstreak Fabricator in creation of a Killstreak Kit.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy goldsex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," enthuses True Companion's website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (is said here: reluctant) Farrah to restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy has a vibrator on its website, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their development and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not stick to sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the marginal zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most appalling aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the sophisticated eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personages," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 phrase: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a certainty of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all ostensibly exert ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftward breeder who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, anyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship, with whom it had fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The dining table is certainly a good thing, but in a wider context it seems to me that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republican must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals are twisting to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perceiving music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience, since two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have rated the carousel I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetic, while tired of having the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a visit to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was taken to hospital due to the treatment of cuts on his wrist victims, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he was holding his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence by Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Agency said that it would raise objections to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and in the United Kingdom 300,000 causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person concerned is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to detect a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"" "the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet of more tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus in Tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Post-doctoral research Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan was investigating a kind of immune cell that favoured tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately housed, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiotics of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but were missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri had grown in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the intolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active ingredient was purified of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan halved halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant producing cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect us in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited next to a yacht in Maine, a Wisconsin fireman and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The Military Office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the chronicle of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," said after publication in front of the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the retired Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false estimation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that reporting of violence in the Domspatzen was measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger into protection," "" "says Heshemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">In a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen, between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" were victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen, sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to many other defendants, many victims have estimated that many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, can even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence against the victims of the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students highlight his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholercian and perfectionist, who became tangible to the Öfteren when a cathedral-sparrow musically offered no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How can you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger seems to be in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or involvement in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can throw it at best, get out of it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzengymnasium" "" "in which he worked was perceived by practically all respondents as" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also portray him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes from children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also gave ear-cheeks to the hair or ears, he even admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be noted, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what actually is going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, Bagatella is admittedly a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "there is no doubt about the fact that many media have just stepped on it with its familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many who never understood him still work diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported about the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also responsible for any involvement or co-existence with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted to the master of the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choral director, who professionally would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioning student wrote: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buying more intrusive or clearer or more open than to their parents, dormitory leaders, legitimate teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "the fact that students and / or their environment affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to acquit anyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be reproached for not being prevented or brought to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to get in touch with these vile crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violence" "" "was read by the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Look" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge plier of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what abuse of the report is.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and painted and suffered, all of them acquired at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most of the witnesses stressed, the topic of" "" "primary school" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this applies equally to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger read the ears consistently before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the punishment will continue to be practiced in the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clearness was, when test sentences were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">In front of it they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to assess where the sufferers might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowable limit had really been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "historians are talking about the" "" "snares of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of assessing the past of today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was broken at the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent child souls, that goes far beyond the customary exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all horrible and I am glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, in other words, to pull the ears and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he was also strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his time in Regensburg has taken Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">"" "did the subject of" "" "test punishment" "" "also come to the language?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective, and the Domspatzen also played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all refuse to have a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candy alone, the rebellious boys will once not make a great singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming of self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamentally benevolent, deeply believing and heartless people, from whom one can't imagine that he could do something just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get along with, like many former Domspatzen today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, regularly visit him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not yet forgiven him that he once was stern to them, therefore, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspans are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and bringing them the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to whom she still looks and whom she downright adores.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: all you are accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intention behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits, and without which nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen at last, would finally be in peace.</seg>
