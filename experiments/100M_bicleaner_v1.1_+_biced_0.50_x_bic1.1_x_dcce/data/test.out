28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally things went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as a murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job six months ago as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
his way of connecting with his family was to cook us something , prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , it was this un@@ polished diamond that lit up every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SF@@ PD sign @-@ up under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or I get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan &quot; exhibition .
most of the time , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , in front of the TV with delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , that is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will start with us on 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they ch@@ ased home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lop .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that was the end of the equ@@ est@@ rian career .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he let himself carry with his family over the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even float for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small Gala the Golden Sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver nes Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the pyramid of sports is long .
in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents for decades .
and so he continued the 25,000 Euro prize money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder of Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ asser , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the glove of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the stadium , where the Lav@@ azza was awarded .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement T@@ TP - this is what Clinton and Tru@@ mp want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
who , about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s intention is to tax the economy to death and to regulate it to death , &quot; he says .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely reverse regulations , and he is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open to dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must invest in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tru@@ mp and Clinton almost wor@@ rying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the re@@ public@@ ans &quot; state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , there could still be party @-@ internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas , he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp acceler@@ ates the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics warn him that the budget deficit would only be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who flee alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby who is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into her arm .
he glan@@ ces curi@@ ously into the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance in Bavaria and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for single @-@ party women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently , she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten to torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ des , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the tu@@ gs are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the shelter in Munich &apos;s North are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations only need for them , requests B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for placing refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their area of responsibility , some answer with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys and their own homes for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or both men and women are housed together , it can happen - continuous violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separate and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush which is given to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new employment training measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor actions in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor actions starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC reported that ministers had agreed to respond to concerns about the contract .
resident doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently kept &quot; problems , which led the contract to be rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official re @-@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor actions starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that Assistant Doc@@ tors went on strike this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions proposed by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students , to conclude that the agreement was to be advantageous and should be adopted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconci@@ le this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be nar@@ rower and he didn &apos;t radi@@ ate heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if nothing bad happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , lasting cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state forgot nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ou@@ tra@@ geous .
Putin par@@ ted and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin of President Erdo@@ gan received the excuse he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed from a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
this week , the State television forecast low @-@ priced fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin , which is pi@@ tied , will benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
for Moscow , this is a matter of course a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me : two countries that feel viol@@ ated and treated badly by the West and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue .
the president of Turkey deliberately refra@@ ined from answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian struggle - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State are at least talking to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to clients outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the brand R@@ BS was linked to the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
the Bank has been dist@@ ancing itself since then , when it had to be nearly collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralised headquarters and stock exchange are changed to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ de , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won to G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached a milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone which only few before him achieved .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thrilled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament hockey .
Frank@@ ie already suffered almost 30 years of winning in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue on competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin firing squ@@ ad of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
for many years IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s tigh@@ test confidence circle .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it says that without stating reasons , Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the cler@@ k and staff manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s main task to support your work as Head of State on bills of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has mysteri@@ ously wo@@ ken Moscow .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ors Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once tou@@ red as a potential president , once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - be tru@@ sting for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V started the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he most trusted .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , since a third term of Putin would viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another coup d &quot; é@@ tat by Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced their dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set there was artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood into it for the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son on a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act for sand@@ a@@ ale that were sp@@ illed from a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck @-@ blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sl@@ ant ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art by a truly epic proportion in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete uss for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this fantastic project , the closure represents future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
tricky because the toler@@ ances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side they were only wor@@ rying a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat ahead of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station crashed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men were having difficulty swimming as their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat cir@@ cled around us and set the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded in the boot of the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has watched over these men today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously hurt - man thrust on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to the apartment in order to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpetrators cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this immediately al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 year old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , investors should be taken a lot more seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a regulation is missing so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , those who want to build on urban areas must in the future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
however , the main point in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to grow at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed , is intended to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , as Brat@@ mann , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get specialists .
but the programme is still not complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you offset the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by 2020 .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be bought out@@ going b@@ ind@@ ings from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price relationship .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , the western city is running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price relationship for cheap apartments .
only : this does not mean the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one is removed from the aim of so @-@ called mixing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social weak in only a few districts will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must be in the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been concentrating on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean that there cannot yet be a compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck worthwhile
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside but rather prefer spending their free time with star@@ ing on screens has been pla@@ gu@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go makes it all about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created for vide@@ og@@ ames in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers over@@ laid .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , they can be &quot; captured &quot; or &quot; captured &quot; via a screen@@ shot .
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ stores each day .
car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of following people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game per@@ ils that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should it do ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
because of poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s nest
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
definitely brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast mel@@ ted on Thursday to title and magni@@ fied the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cap A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American woman Simone Bil@@ es shows on the floating beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman winning a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth , while consoli@@ dating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning both gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight in@@ ale of women at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on never having planned the future during its long way to the top , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a young child and trained by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school flight to the gym , trained in Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since summer 2013 , it has lost no more competition for competition , a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes .
although Mu@@ staf@@ a was slightly til@@ ted by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
bri@@ g@@ beam and boom @-@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - l@@ ur@@ k .
she caught up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and set one on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner as the vision she once described in her collection book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her til@@ lage she kno@@ cked the audience to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : three victims in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ held fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery , since the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to see if they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in h@@ is@@ panic living quarters within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of its anci@@ ents , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to worry about that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embark@@ ed on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could not sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund has thought of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me a little &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we give it a sign language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a multitude of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainf@@ all , floods give rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale flooding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana compelled the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards agreed that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared the requests for flood , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood early warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a river @-@ downward flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still trun@@ ked people from the flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and son @-@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek waters , which are usually located more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step @-@ man who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river during the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning was 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been completely su@@ cked by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa sends 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches which were now in@@ und@@ ated .
the Chief of the Rob@@ by Miller congregation said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed out of the flood .
there were emergency shel@@ ters in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond to accommodate the evacu@@ ated people .
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their houses , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and sand@@ bags for the inhabitants were provided for taking part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the disaster manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a handful of homes were reported to be flooded on Thursday , but no reported until now .
Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; thrown out by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including the l@@ ende , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at the hospital when he was transported to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his little body was pun@@ ishing by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Dol@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical condition , reported to the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to different assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wn the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is a permanent struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the road , were shells .
thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a squ@@ ad on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police search for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present to myself under the women &apos;s Olympic Games in Tur@@ nen and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three female gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Roman Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts has been an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and praised America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ event event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this kind of sport , but we do not see trainers throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four tur@@ ners in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but reality looks like Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gymnas@@ tics that are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their tur@@ ner and families ) .
the majority of these sports clubs are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , coach of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymnas@@ tics .
we have to offer the congreg@@ ations au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gymnas@@ tics exercise .
I founded my TR@@ C for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ asts in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth top @-@ quality gymn@@ asts that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong health benefits as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted for a vote rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans have revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident doctors are expected to have a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care at un@@ as@@ sail@@ able times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ ants , announced last night in a statement : &quot; Assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed Treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and will admini@@ ster it to address all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by meeting the government for the sake of resist@@ ing and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done only last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekend payment for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , called on the doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor action measures do nothing but little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries with a positive response to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that continued positive involvement on other key topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training camps , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education UK and the Ministry of Health were concerned with the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 per day medication after it was recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ HS regulator is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulator is recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that stops the flow of blood to the heart and causes a heart attack .
if the blood c@@ lot dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and stop the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons already having a heart attack are subject to higher risk another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British firm A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the introductory draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people already having a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture raises election fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report on corruption from office
a Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , ignor@@ ing it as a devastating governmental report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of election abuse based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diso@@ be@@ dience on eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up cord@@ ons outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a vote to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions on non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and finance culture that goes hand in hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election scandal in eastern London .
last year , a special court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation by which a person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming to the dec@@ eit@@ ful choice of letters - when older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guide of evi@@ denti@@ als to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , in particular women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with a Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have deliberately ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities in eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric identified 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists process letters of paper to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration ex@@ ams to prevent the electoral list to be used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has quit her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications to an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of post @-@ elections .
the police give the authority to set up barriers to electoral stations .
a change in the law that facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out the rule that voters will go to the bal@@ lot alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal charges were made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Council called Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Elec@@ toral Regi@@ stration departments of the Town Hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heir to the Mother of the Par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of touch with the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ leg@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only one to defend the gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic tok@@ ens showing more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s double @-@ carrier on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ mature could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ c@@ anny .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great resem@@ b@@ lance , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I know it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is to be able to go through as a double @-@ member for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one passage higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter Schauspiel@@ erin Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others noticed the similarities too .
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user explained their cont@@ ent@@ ment that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are nearly identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter Schauspiel@@ erin Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas showing her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is dead like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos; analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m shared spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ al games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; like M@@ ief was going off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone was turned off when he put his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Individu@@ al Squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went off like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimming@@ pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by sound and language
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Individu@@ al Squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many of them were talking
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC appe@@ aled in the end for more than 90 times with the people responding to the emerg@@ ent Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to excuse himself in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to make one clear , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried to wash her under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room she took a pair of pants from the delivery , pulled out their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , went back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had it and pulled out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident happening on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were taken out of the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your predat@@ or .
if you approach you from the back then you should turn around first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; get out of the firing line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder before hitting your face with your free el@@ bow .
then bend his knee into the bar and twist the weapon from his hands while the att@@ acker falls into pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the barrel and move backwards while they turn the gun on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , store the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun out of its grip , before they move backwards and turn the gun on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it works Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ bery it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - unless you are a Grand@@ master Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ s for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and worms of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scra@@ pped his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping each object , he used a lumin@@ ary to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to lick the sink of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he left behind , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to railway stations to washing @-@ up buttons of toilets , the task turned his immune system down defini@@ tively to a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial painting showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their L@@ umin@@ ometer was more than 4000 units , while fresh washed hands had one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the tour film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have heard in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics at the same time .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how they are linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had directed to him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ isi were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cking employees of the housing cooperative found property in a irre@@ parable condition .
the walls pointed lou@@ dly , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , garbage was spread on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people do not have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is believed to be considered as a not as beautiful part of the Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , disputes and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up .
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing over@@ threw her and her partner forci@@ bly from the estate this week after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ ids were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years .
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to assume any responsibility for their behavior and family as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step taken into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have bra@@ vely approached us and provided the information to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial indul@@ gence .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house &apos;s walls were gra@@ ffiti painted .
the police says they will act rent@@ ers who do not stick to the rules of the house

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate a criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start panic after a eff@@ er@@ ful jet fell over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew almost in pal@@ p@@ able proximity to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without seeing first what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deeply flew .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said the jet flew lower than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility . however , the air forces insi@@ sts that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the mainland during this summer , where four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the re@@ play rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ gew@@ inner must abst@@ ain from the fight with the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League champion , among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who den@@ ies the Olympic So@@ ccer Tournam@@ ent with Brazil .

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen dri@@ fts in Barcelona for two years as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications had the advantage .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ z@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince me .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 @-@ defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
with up to now eleven achievements , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in a separate league table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12 : 5,@@ 4 ) in a one @-@ sided finale .
the World Cup leader brought the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; to World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the singles @-@ title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they pulled back to the tri@@ bun@@ e and left off their prot@@ ru@@ ding in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the match up here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the domin@@ ance of Ma developed not the expected ro@@ using Match .
but nevertheless enough breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .

Donald Tru@@ mp appro@@ ves &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states losing their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now announced weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ track and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as little concern as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp out of the race , doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blame was false reports of his candi@@ dat@@ ure , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or in June , Tru@@ mp and his competitor were equal to the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia are also considered .
in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him in the end for political correctness , that was fine , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of living .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party is said to have threatened to withdraw money to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead of trying to strengthen the Republi@@ can nom@@ inees for Congress .
Olympics : triple dec@@ eption in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced to establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village had delivered a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Red .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Association has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to impose its own investigations , a spokesman for the IA@@ AF announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the ensu@@ ing actions of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and was issued as F@@ erg@@ uson , Red I , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich became World Cup fourth in 2015 more than 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Track &amp; Field Leader , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly was arrested on his return to Nairobi airport .
according to numerous dop@@ ing clubs in Kenya , Kenya has been under special scrut@@ iny for some time now .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls presented by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a great deal of pressure on African land before the Summer Games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose fight against dop@@ ing is consistent with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Peking .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , alleg@@ ations have been made that dop@@ ing funds are readily available in Kenya and there is a considerable mentality of sport dec@@ eption .
at last , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed her in the Russian athle@@ tics field .
in doing so , it was possible to demonstrate that in this kind of sport there was widespread and systematic thought .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , like Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Mary as a youth centre .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musically extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , to my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics and they are as powerful today as they did at the time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family returned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - preventing people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London rose to a plane in Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the event of an election victory at Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain the candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is convinced that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he wasn &apos;t talking to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court Ju@@ dge for the District of Columbia .
RAID said re@@ public@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naked calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys differenti@@ ates himself as Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting show in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is seated on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish commune of Germany counts on short notice with tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association believes Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ gen strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity even months ago , 500,000 Kurds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the ice @-@ covered put@@ sch , another secular and op@@ posi@@ tional eth@@ ni@@ cal Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state capable of taking up refugees in their own country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the group leader compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president demanded that the federal government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer kills teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ret@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had the largest group of asylum @-@ citizens recognised in Germany because of political persecution .
as of June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people , almost 29 per cent of all who have been recognised as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or perspective .
asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are purely political , i.e. from the state side , individually pursu@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for more stupid than to date it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the campaig@@ ners , are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers traveling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a local , so don &apos;t vote for the Land@@ tag .
in addition there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers can hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count voices in the end , only rub@@ b@@ ish .
up to the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to let the people pass by just close to the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how much newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ - du@@ sty .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age , and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels through the country , spread the roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as he did his legendary wor@@ dless predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , seaf@@ ar@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has blame for the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you &apos;re in the right place in the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale meetings ; Merkel parliament &apos;s circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not ren@@ ounce the usual election distances at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means Kok@@ ert means playing only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you have the basis that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the vast@@ ness of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U campaign co@@ co@@ ons to its comrades is self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , Every Bir@@ th@@ day Party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on its SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ gging 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
from the holiday necessity they make a modern virtue and embarrass@@ ed their electoral campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Landes@@ presi@@ ding Claudia Müller &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green election warri@@ ors embar@@ k on trace search for domestic voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just curves with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
there is always praise for those in charge of the construction works that start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end only at about 8@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything a bit jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the receipt of the goods responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft drives .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ dingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation in the village has eased .
the citizens can now move from O@@ fan@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the journey through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive director Florian King for the vice @-@ technical management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ mann Street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were seeking and more familiar to their nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ ying in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality increased the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant head@@ lines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself over the spot himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been two to three per minute .
the fastest was travelling with 77 kilometres per hour in the 30 @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to break@@ through@@ s in them , everyone you ask can look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership of Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily explo@@ ded are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .

&quot; &quot; &quot; street renov@@ ations have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , retired District Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner about whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts where something has been handled more generous .
at all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
finally , the family @-@ run business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic flow , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also very beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ clientele came back to the end of the renovation works .
despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
the fight against terror is constantly ro@@ uted in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a big security package .
but what does a toler@@ ation status do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically un@@ reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ charge anybody .
other , further @-@ reaching points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was based on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , filed : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on air passenger dates and weapons legislation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to raise symp@@ athetic advertising for terrorist groups and knock jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans high @-@ speed procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and expose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their documents in order to mask their identity .
some of these are politically and legally cont@@ ested .
many things are still un@@ balanced and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people worried about security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with people could not be cl@@ inging up even in election times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security has moved enormously into the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , it has been high between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a secret dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the Union &apos;s interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling with conci@@ li@@ atory notes .
he has nothing to stop from having departed from a double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have paci@@ fied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ open it does not make sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show up .
there &apos;s a lot in everything that could cause controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ long itself on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel once again cau@@ ti@@ ously signals the readiness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen does not get off lightly .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the number of deliveries worldwide increases .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall action there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term .
Volkswagen starts delivery in the second half of the year with deliveries .
despite the diesel boom , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , can advance further growth in the previous year .
but in July the main brand , VW , was particularly weak@@ ening in Western Europe and therefore poll@@ uted the total sales , as announced by the company in Da@@ x .
in July , the Volkswagen brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales remained 14 percent below the prior @-@ year month .
in the home market Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of brand sales , led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU also stressed a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ bear@@ ers first ES@@ CA@@ LA@@ TED , a minus is also ech@@ o@@ ed .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to get off lightly due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent refers to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show an increase in sales from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust @-@ gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the conversion , VW confirms that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was indicated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen is now providing its German customers with a guarantee of ref@@ unded diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully satisfied the print runs of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting will not take place , and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not how it was called business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term &quot; War@@ ran@@ ty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop six months after the change@@ over - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interest of the customer , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal@@ ous scandal will result in uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations , as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands for extensive savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal spar@@ ers must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks invest money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0.4 percent penalty .
in September , Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is calling for private and corporate clients for deposits exceeding € 100,000 for deposits and daily accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will be 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he hats around 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now higher .
to leave cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the ban@@ ker .
most customers would have understanding and change to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically lasting not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 marked head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits of € 3 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele with a wealth of opul@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they deposit money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other banks known to charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ ban@@ ken und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ ban@@ ken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and the migration of investors is threatening to compete .
the customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in its width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle aged love boards .
before heading to the commentary piece , to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ mon@@ wealth men of the Middle ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the manifold re@@ formation of records is not attributable to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als that want to embrace the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mi@@ dd@@ le@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers always retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and run wild before I stick , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I wrote by Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers he meets to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom to fans of the record @-@ re@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers picked up the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves , of items that call for happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is so important to me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way of dealing spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ cked from a record store . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player .
at this point in the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoo@@ ther through a stack of Bos@@ sa nova compilation .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ t@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ eds from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks stran@@ gely emp@@ tied , but wet psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to find if one stands next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more a window @-@ bet@@ rot@@ ter than a shopping mall .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am preten@@ ding to smu@@ g@@ gle the jeans in the pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who for a moment group around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send down to the depths of Soh@@ o , there &apos;s nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one who spends most of it on luxury items such as panels .
even if my research has shown that the results of you@@ go@@ v vote , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums will not be considered .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bo@@ omer@@ ang through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while they steer clear of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong host who stands above the shoulders of no middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 tent@@ ative businesses in which people sell goods , cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy that would not pay taxes and which offer a risk of fire and security .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in a charitable way and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants &apos; estimates on Friday that the number of refugees in the mosque was increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ appointing performance in the Olympic cycling race , Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get involved .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and continue to fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in silence what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin really wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meas@@ ur@@ ers : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident zones , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed limits , there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that speed limits are met with a stationary speed car .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in continuous measuring operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits and driving b@@ ans according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply st@@ acked , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear in a safe outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the lightning from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also gl@@ are with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain catches silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fiji divided a master class in the Handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , back @-@ back , line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to it in the final .
but irrespective of this , a 15 @-@ man team would have been beaten in this form in this form .
it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - at least one br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck : fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under Ryan , she lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this can@@ opy will hurt , but progress is astonishing .
Fiji had a wonderful start and had fun boun@@ cing the GB@@ s .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell on and Co. as if you ran into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au sm@@ iled in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a ring@@ ing T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute vibr@@ ating j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the revival and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pushed through other weak Tac@@ tics of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still there .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South African sul@@ tan , whose fans sang flags and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked cr@@ ammed into the grass .
earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race at a tight half @-@ fin@@ als - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown pushed the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no worse gold than with those games and that will mean what is called .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard ch@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an extra note in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was there when she rowed to the second Olympic Champion in a two @-@ man without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th impro@@ mp@@ tu operation , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that was the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were sufficient .
that is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning with it more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for me .
they were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anybody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far than exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was now retired at the age of 65 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and one has always resum@@ ed innovations because water means living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia &quot; Water Forum .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised the water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a loyal tee .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe burst at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ stei@@ g on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained once , because it is filled with hoses from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko deals openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she should die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago has come forward well and now learn privately in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship @-@ at in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on life @-@ partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ tice .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ tice .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the gun with him , the police .
if you see Sven S. , call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship @-@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information on the death or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ator and the victim , but confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
STAHL - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Con@@ dition in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to ask the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y is 20 percent .
but even this would not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production .
so the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand China threw masses on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers introduce price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties imposed on import steel are effective , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China has risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp decided not to shut down individual works .
at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , the German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , such as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced crowd went back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors do good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she took the course of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing is emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and her mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sang in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , described H@@ ac@@ kler .
thanks to regular connections , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to meet and to organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
in doing so , Sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who regularly challenges his lungs does not get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life either .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even people who suffer from dementia are sin@@ king back to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time to concentrate on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people , who live alone , practice so as not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced through singing in the choir , meaning H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem increases also through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I look for something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes next to it ?
on the search for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone is singing from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ ver on scre@@ ams of the young
in Hanover , bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect of the litter of cat litter on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ cks also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al degree of k@@ itt@@ ens in the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to ly@@ es of k@@ itt@@ ens that are in great need , as scientists have found out at the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones , who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , responded to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this faculty may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males ever responded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala . &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kiss is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kiss .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was imposed after the crash test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , it is not possible to stop football either .
the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kiss .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the exceptional state of emergency for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this does not affect the lives of most Turks but as good as there is no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what unites the Great Britain in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy , we will be especially happy to arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory finale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the first round of the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were eliminated early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g , it reached only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ que @-@ King .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in spite of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays , the Gom@@ ez just borrowed under the Treaty of Florence and at Bes@@ ik@@ tas had announced that it was not to return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wishes to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Princip@@ al F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to for@@ ego about a third of his annual salary , estimated at 7.5 million Euros , &quot; Or@@ man realized : &quot; we cannot pay for his salary in Florence . &quot;

it was a strange scene : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she noticed that she was not going to fetch gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ bery .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite D@@ oping &apos;s past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ times champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was proven to stop the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation , she had a strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , mar@@ ched mer@@ ges .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ fall , Belarus ) : hardly an athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having seen testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympics @-@ Silver 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone ab@@ uses .
he was also awarded the 2008 Olympic Games bronze medal due to a verdict of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record woman and Gold favorite was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , references to taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA has been mil@@ dly and expi@@ red on July 13 .
terror terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have suffered cuts and have been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the vac@@ ant island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , is still unclear .
in this regard , the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , such as sn@@ u@@ gs .
on Thursday evening , around 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded in two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and another man was killed by the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong who was popular with holi@@ day@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured following police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban worker .
according to the authorities in a flower shop , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast , as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast claimed several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express possible motives - but most likely it is the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern which is typical of the Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts &quot; bom@@ b@@ ings in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that is limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
in recent days , the authorities have received secret evidence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bombs , but most of the time it is not against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bom@@ b@@ astic explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and environ@@ s .
after conflicts between the security forces and the Muslim populations , travelling to these provinces is not necessary .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , has prof@@ ited itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous revolt of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok in a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also led the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indications for aspir@@ ations against the free @-@ democratic basic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Constitutional Court , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic fai@@ ths or from the Middle East are em@@ itted in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; is already observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempt to pick up their target group wherever it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts are generally trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not publicity for your own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable there .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he had no knowledge about that .
possible contacts of this species are only relevant to the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - will change its direction and become extrem@@ ist by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the significant increase of right @-@ wing criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said that in this context he would not speak of new right terrorism .
but we have found in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the Frei@@ tal group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be quite possible that more right @-@ wing groups or small groups are forming to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of sec@@ rec@@ y @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who hadn &apos;t appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspect in case of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings were previously unknown as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that had nothing at all with the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example elected CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympics or World Records are dominating the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ ck during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am so slowly that the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he could not be seen in the TV pictures at times .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ ré was subsequently used for viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a gap of 48 seconds and finished in 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not straight athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participating in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ asit wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ uble of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity ban &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to take over 100 metres of free @-@ style in a run @-@ up .
f@@ rene@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp sees the threat of electoral defeat not so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tru@@ mp , speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him in the end for political correctness , that is fine , Tru@@ mp said .
thus he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties in the sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post office speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months now , the company has been examining whether they are delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered to other companies .

in its post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ der had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and made a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
on 1 September the management board of the Management Board will take over the previous Executive Board member Gerhard Inter@@ erk@@ inger , who shared the company .
he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; spokesperson for the board , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann is found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the reason for the return , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokesman on Friday did not want to call details .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in investor circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the most recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this was the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company was unable to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .

in relation to the first half of the year , sales of € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million declined by 3.4 percent .
earnings in the second quarter mainly affected the company &apos;s decreased value due to its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s value depreci@@ ation , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business area of 139 million euros , secured a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
in the event of an accident of 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to give way to an accommod@@ ating vice , who partially drove on the counter .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the un@@ event@@ ful travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n district of Pe@@ w@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus to the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fee per cubic meter of wastewater will amount to 2.@@ 10 euros from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf € 3.@@ 64 ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a slu@@ gg@@ ish calculation , the wastewater fee in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the household by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Council established that there were under@@ coverings for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost @-@ covering level .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se .
revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and / or under@@ coverings from the preceding calculation period can be equ@@ aled .
Schmidt therefore reas@@ oned the serious fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water , which ranges between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , all three plants were not least appreci@@ able due to their age of rehabilitation and repair expendi@@ tures .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ zel , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp for almost 20 years .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf wastewater system .
in the pumping station Wel@@ zel had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up to almost 20 years and the first sewage treatment plant L@@ opp had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level in previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs for the wastewater facilities has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses in the long term , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal san@@ itation association cannot be extended by these facilities , because these facilities are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first to zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a rise in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the pre @-@ month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell by clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the morning at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian carto@@ onist
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it &apos;s in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ brid@@ led , property @-@ turning tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carriage returns to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
when a filter suggested a filter this week that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat said it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism have reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and the least said unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filtering effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ secured , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the disc@@ arded extremis@@ m .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that insul@@ ts for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as Product Manager and Engineer to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an article on the medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that lightning @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the use practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended its essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and refers to its status as a private company .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on sub@@ du@@ ed population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she would have closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Gui@@ delines Ver@@ dict Daesh intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command have modified intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual conditions on site were allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and Armed Forces Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content under Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , near Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information provided by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com commissions regularly drew a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com representative publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
the second largest city in Iraq , Mos@@ ul , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called Task Force to live after they were as@@ cri@@ bed to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s general inspec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ level demo@@ cr@@ at in the committee , member of the Adam B. Schiff Represent@@ ative House , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given excessive space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a white house intervention at the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress proceedings were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ com analysts .
Mr. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investig@@ ators of the General inspec@@ tor were still under way .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermedi@@ aries of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward only to a small occupying army in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put in operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature due to his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .

however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed the strong Dut@@ chman a little longer out of the way the other group leads .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex during their success story , four years after they ended up at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 when everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have the ru@@ dder to pull around completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back @-@ stroke from the near @-@ area .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the American a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book one goal in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
surrounded by the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is handed from the wrist protection to the float to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dim@@ ples , could have been among these known names sent to prime time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the swim and may it prevail for a long time .
but if I have enough arguments for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so spar@@ sely perceived that many of them , I questioned , didn &apos;t know that it was a kind of Olympic Port at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had had an athlete that made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ ns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but just a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El Tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
upcoming winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ping and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympi@@ ad , you will be assessed according to the version , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists have to go farther , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also in the television broadcast another high goal : the world or the Olympic Capital .
the purpos@@ eful striving is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel to be somewhat ti@@ ring while watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 onwards .
amid the Olympia @-@ man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spru@@ ce and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
non@@ violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia breaking together ?
in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government shake the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed eigh@@ ty un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests which are probably the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism beyond the region , particularly in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or to prison , killed or pushed into the vast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which in recent years have been forced more or less , to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of war@@ ping under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians told them that they were assembled as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly Christian high @-@ nationals from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ i@@ ens , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are about coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had until his death on an un@@ published sickness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 after thousands prot@@ ested against elections , seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the ra@@ ids that followed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray became increasingly common in the social media .
analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ enberg flights over the neighboring Somalia , although she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin line of terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declares his asser@@ tion Obama had formed ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would not have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings along its comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of it during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements that it could not have meant at all .
having made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism came down to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the business situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic limits in politics and then ru@@ de if necessary .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has assumed an even more caus@@ al tone as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but as he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it am@@ mun@@ itions , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister , allowed ISIS to spread by aggres@@ sively taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ oted cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were supp@@ ressed .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , replacing it in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people took it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is alter@@ ation , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York change is change , it is also a new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained a lot .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural beau@@ ties .
the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also sup@@ planted by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shut down &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she gave up the coffee @-@ drink for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was about coffee and culture in the litter that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she made a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the auction in 2003 .
he went there before work and inv@@ ari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not make a gru@@ dge that the soap shop took the old business room .
indeed , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for refin@@ ing Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
CO@@ Es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the US , while bri@@ ck@@ men were told in their book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes .
when the re@@ porter clari@@ fied h@@ ack@@ ers , this found the couple fitting for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid itself in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the ways the country went with , not to be the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans became a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as &quot; a wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noticed that coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends were tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prevailed over flavor or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions not match each other .
it was typical for many of the home business recipes .
as never before or since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - der@@ id the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house@@ keeping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if Ele@@ an@@ or &apos;s wife had asked him to make an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , the host of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours led by Mrs. Roosevelt to cause the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science has been applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a brick man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag incident .
after the plat@@ ters were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosevelt ate at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a nasty trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone was reluct@@ ant to t@@ ame a spoon into the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
Co@@ E won three times a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ gel@@ tler , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to the picture paper , saved nearly 60,000 people living . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers bet their own lives in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian guard who showed him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quoted his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Green@@ lan@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k on the bottom of the North Atlantic along , in one hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a lush 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle inspired by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
by Felix F. Sei@@ dler . Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheit@@ spolitik . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein , from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ bi@@ ologist believed long ago that Greenland sh@@ arks are st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live above all in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s hair .
their time @-@ slow @-@ pent@@ ec@@ os measured them , when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ped@@ oes from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
therefore , after the early 1960s , its birth was supposed to lie in the atmosphere of producing large amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere as a search for nuclear weapons .
on the other hand , in the third smallest animal in the length of the third smallest animal , the lens nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , which should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
in contrast , all major Greenland sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 levels in their lens core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record sh@@ arks with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res should be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined by 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ ali@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip was stuck , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics related to building , the council at the recent meeting has focused on the main focus .
with relief , the Panel noted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ cel@@ ering and development questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be placed on sur@@ veying , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ ber@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ tension section 1 ) will no longer be possible for interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au address young families and other senior citizens alike .
as it was said , construction volunteers can now register in the Town Hall , and the allocation of the plots is expected to be advised in its September session .
in order to meet even en@@ quiries relating to the settlement of other businesses linked to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created space plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Regional Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether bor@@ der@@ houses are allowed to operate further from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is not enough for them to be approved in the UK .
these are just great US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts on 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which is responsible for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , and other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Assessment ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg is certainly a major fund industry , but it also cuts off in infrastructure like Dublin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city is also home to readily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W appro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector worked in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead ob@@ tains legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. presi@@ ding judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to refund the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents in Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of a complaint on Thursday , US office judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ ance on the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to bring Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used to su@@ e each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , which included sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are running clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return on Friday for 2015 , this resulted in the presidential candidates of the Democrats and her husband a $ 10.@@ 75 million in@@ comes and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable causes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton delivered $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ariums ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candid@@ acy for vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter for the publication of the presidential candidates of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed into the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish its tax declaration .
on Thursday she spoke to the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or very little taxes for two years , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , Tru@@ mp approached a meeting to share their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to IR@@ S tax audit and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has res@@ igned tax return until 2007 .
Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that it was only USD 100 of its income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fireworks promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , has intensified its promotion with the US nature protection by exercising volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , using a non@@ violent Four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world telep@@ hon@@ y day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed this ...

the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not scared , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media alarm after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election as the Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s electoral list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and er@@ ased ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director addressed the hotel reception .
the answer he received was &quot; scho@@ oling him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it dis@@ b@@ anded more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann employee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and shocked by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident attracted a fairly large response from the Internet , in which people called it a scandal .
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have yiel@@ ded the alleged appeals of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the Quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police op@@ ts tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led the police to submit rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo , Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying against preliminary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies take up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign agency issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as regards the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

the wrong@@ do@@ ers should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the offen@@ ders must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way and be fled from the gravel car park located opposite the park entrance with the silver car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Sle@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ bery should report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun at summer time
eight beautiful and cheerful days spent the children and young people of the Social Ped@@ ago@@ gical Day Group / social group work of the Nag@@ old children &apos;s protection association with their car@@ ers during their summer vac@@ ancy in Nuss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the quiet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the joyful group was quartered in the first school holiday week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ essel with the visit of the stro@@ king zoo .
to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous convent .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
culinary treats were p@@ am@@ pered by children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared bodies like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were rolled , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill @-@ game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to Gateway to Mer@@ cy
the Mini @-@ stran@@ ts from the soul care unit E@@ glan@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch ( St. Anna ) were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were completed .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ s@@ pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in the next two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the gate of mercy opened at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ole , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Holy chambers , went their way .
the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration , blessed the pilgrimage and par@@ ted the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a cathedral of Our Lady was standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m Path came from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is returned to field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els and churches again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller care for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped onto the stage after St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but had to drop some 500 metres in altitude during the heat and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the beach in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy .
God thank@@ ed God with a little impulse .
at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is of the Co @-@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s goal .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day there was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner r@@ ushes home , as Br@@ ite &apos;s Gold R@@ ings for Rad@@ sport
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor he had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the yacht made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place in London in March despite the re @-@ entry Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a sign up .
Ho@@ ys &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in the qualifying laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was slightly back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and give me a name .
in the final round , we set up an Olympic champion and defeated the world champi@@ ons .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ ds admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bike stream .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometer race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he was argu@@ ing with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to compete for his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ ell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the mid period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background drama played out in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director , in April , surrounded by sex@@ ism and bul@@ ging arrangements , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy yield dou@@ bt@@ ful
the future of the aluminium mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ ing@@ work@@ men - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus canc@@ els all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company communicated .
this step followed the government decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy established for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be end@@ owed with closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting pot consum@@ es about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , most recently , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sh@@ ale with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue to AG@@ L as of the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L informed that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa told us that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not affect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that 2010 had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year , even if it is not yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt into Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements made by the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year and around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity each year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , scor@@ ched reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the cl@@ attering plot of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a TV station at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the region of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim loves her as far as the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista have been advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the company &apos;s 6@@ 15 page advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still perme@@ ated before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that are model@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success does not appeal to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers has always been somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ thers of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but looking around on the gri@@ m@@ ity seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she is selling pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal centres annually reject 16@@ 0.000 people
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies are aver@@ ted annually by the municipal law centers , while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - in their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already operating exc@@ essively , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the Director of the Gover@@ ning Centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the latest survey by the National Council of Community Centr@@ es concluded that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government , the situation would only get worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with confusing and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dis@@ sent - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to see the needs of community centers and their community communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of recru@@ iting co @-@ workers
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ activity after it was told that their campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun rif@@ le to an employee while they were on their way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before real@@ ising that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , laid his right index finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the barrel of Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to do harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - gun@@ men and weapons friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton would be elected and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media had ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not rise to violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary complaint asks for damages from the campaign for violation of the duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s Press spokesperson for Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey in front of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this asser@@ ted representative surveys of IN@@ SA opinion research institute for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could no longer rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head to the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors now dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the west pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , even though very slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could gu@@ essed in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart phone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and processed to Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is everyday for many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the Mac World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple started , and today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ glow .
she finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to om@@ it the Smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and throw He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlar@@ ging He@@ a@@ throw is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion of wit@@ ch@@ craft growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion @-@ expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London games of 2012 were great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its Des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding on its advertisements to make it difficult to detect advertisements about which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokesman of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of ad block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display block@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue .
the company has opposed ad block@@ ers to desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a large share of revenues so that Facebook is worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , so we have instead focused on Develop@@ ers tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway crossing
the victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police call on witnesses after a woman was left on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday during a suspected suicide by several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill herself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police who sum@@ mon@@ ed them as well as any witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter , Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not being held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the car drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having passed over and killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the road , he took the court .
the court noted that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have en@@ vi@@ ded similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly moved forward .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect against evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turn of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously assumed by planet researchers .
although it was probably hab@@ itable , Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billions years of --@@ over several billion years .
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their steam was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy stepping back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a too low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively @-@ president / general manager of the Color@@ ad@@ ores Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him greater depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization &apos;s vision .
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organisation and we wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy was honored as the best coach of the league in the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the last season in either of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild card spot at the Western Conference by five points .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ o@@ sts resume talks again , strike strike &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the struggles for wages for North Sea oil workers will be suspended while all the parties set out for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally held on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start next year to tackle the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s ratings follows a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts would give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed tens of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had reinforced the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet creation .
&quot; we hope to find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster lies 4@@ 45 light years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated about 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest now .
to peak rot@@ ational rates , these mat@@ uring stars hit large amounts of star @-@ win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
in three newspaper articles , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 year old pro will wear the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys for the last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to join , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ star All @-@ Star Game participant of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as a consultant and youth coach in future - at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es made some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be taken into the resting @-@ hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have forbidden stero@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis scandal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league would even have done a favor for me in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days do not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .

Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an experienced athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing events took place in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle runner , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
Ch@@ en had already demonstrated the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Criminal Court , CA@@ S , confirmed the exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the IO@@ C has applied for the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio , the news irrit@@ ated the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ger@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tic Field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it should be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the banned substance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Probe should also have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly announced his speech to the people of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday the event &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested , like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , three days before positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , especially the fall of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation producing Kenya produces a lot of bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier references in China for violent confron@@ tations also had taken care of among the athletes .
the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing malware are currently using targeted businesses - and are successful .
according to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ lue to attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ ma@@ iled falls considerably higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ator discovered black@@ mail software for himself .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it sel@@ ectively searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail press .
to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ise Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of German companies affected sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break down their business activities , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ator &apos;s demand in view of stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their victims by chat@@ ting how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t example files .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must sometimes negotiate with hard bar@@ gaining and pay five @-@ digit amounts to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , says Security Expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski of the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits have been developed so that malware , consulting and additional tools have been purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski .
the Pres@@ ses are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the ground , buy the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will be made per authenti@@ cated machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of companies IT executives in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to defend ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calcul@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damages , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V built on the same new platform as the new jazz proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in the front row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit side of the cockpit is noticeable .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ down and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a box and thus offer storage space that is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the charge height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of revolutions .
he should do his job a bit qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine specification : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not available .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamic and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistance assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed sensor responds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if necessary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI connector are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standards .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only conceivable with risks typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee cap during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of living , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case report : when paid by the organizer
after their trip , sick tourists will only get money when the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without any doubt .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have the same symptoms .
in the case of a negotiated case , on the second day of its door@@ step , a family was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been defective - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the organizer learned about it only shortly before the departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of disclosure , so the judgement .
especially since there were no contam@@ in@@ ants found in the water samples .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state needs to be so@@ ber and determined at the same time to react to terror attacks .
surely , our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph for the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , this raises the security and also strengthens the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by 2017 .
he also announced further personnel reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right to vote will be improved so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently extensively discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should remain in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with physicians , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat to citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly declared himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general ban on full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Simone Peter designed the minister to simul@@ ate action power and ability to act with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist partner Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway br@@ inger
it st@@ aves itself regularly on the circum@@ fer@@ ential road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal bi@@ dding is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who are standing in traffic on the ambient road every evening in the traffic jam when driving over the motorway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße to the right @-@ hand bend lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is breaking up early , thus improving the overall procedure on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district &apos;s advoc@@ acy , Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerve anno@@ ys drivers , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ cave on the B 51 shortly before the departure of the Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is driven only one lane across the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be disman@@ tled just over a quarter of a century ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge is no longer the force required to record heavy @-@ duty traffic in two lanes .
the competent regional company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic jam will last .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction procedure , the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays because it was to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
inter@@ cultural trip : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the prize @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years spent the staging of the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , so the Short news of the Young Theatre in Münster .
the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will receive the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has taken the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night a das@@ h through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ lets are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their names because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the alarm clock no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , there are such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
what are sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be a variety of causes for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for In@@ flu@@ ency and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you normally understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ing and sleeping disorder .
just feeling sleep@@ y many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ alth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors are dependent on each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie poorly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to brood over everyday problems and worries , We@@ eks is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I become a doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is no shortage of sleep medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
this is why sleeping problems should first be addressed to the family doctor , she advises Kris .
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breath@@ ers , for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing pro@@ positions , in case of sickness , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera monitors the sleeping stops on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws that can be used for a better sleep .
at the end of the day , it &apos;s time to go to sleep , not to sleep too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch television for falling asleep , stop drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ appointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he scored gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has turned over to his ex @-@ team @-@ mate in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets € 20,000 bonus and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 € should no one be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on the night .
the conveyor system in swimming pools is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to report nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice @-@ cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday civil investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suspect had committed several hand@@ bags and bags as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences during the mid @-@ July of this year and were involved in a community @-@ based , cooperative and professional manner .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can demonstrate four acts , which were especially lod@@ ged for crimes against Germany .
in the process , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den bro@@ o@@ ks , in between a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
after passing the street from east to west , you pass play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks , however , with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator H@@ enkel died several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ go zones &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ or@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , pat@@ ro@@ ls the police three weeks of official statement , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers pulled off the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who lives here three children , are mostly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z that mostly wants police protection against the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between house staff@@ s and their neighbors , obviously don &apos;t exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which also today has a low average income and high poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under heavy police command in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from around the world in recent years : with them , residents of East Germany and former domestic occup@@ iers share their Kie@@ z .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on disc@@ arded disks or newly painted fac@@ ades that have been disc@@ arded with dy@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily concerned about crime : crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes make property damage , which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94 , uncertainty cannot be mentioned .
when it comes to violence , it is important : the people of the 94 are their neighbours , they have certainly not been .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
that is why it was also so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , they are con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many of us here , rather people who are not so well cared for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely cannot appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
for newcom@@ ers who are angry about color bombs Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who go there should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee agency
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group points out that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ y is now there , the ei@@ ving wo@@ olen pur@@ se , which has a problem above all .
this meant some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing rather than the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job out .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , just an apprenticeship in Woll@@ mel@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers are located in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the municipalities themselves have to bear the costs of building , rent or renov@@ ating these accommodations .
the responsibility changes from the Land Registry Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it doesn &apos;t work , except for private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
for this reason , common apartments have to be re@@ conditioned as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be erected in the Was@@ sen@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished .
&quot; more seats would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community will lead to positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and mainly language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here are administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motiv@@ ating .
but there are problem cases too , says customer honestly , &quot; People that do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are they afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , also in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may pret@@ end to be nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ tised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also the subject of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would make them complete .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , main and honorary officials must look for activities locally and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question is clearly to be answered , the policy is afraid .
it is actually unfair to spot them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
the Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been used to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
