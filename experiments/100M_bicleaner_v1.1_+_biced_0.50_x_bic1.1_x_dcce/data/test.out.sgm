<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Originaltitel: CSI: crime Scene Investigation (TV)</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively reverse regulations, and he is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open to disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the republicans "state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could still be party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in far-protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly extend and demand renewables with its investment programme: "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump accelerates the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics warn him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrower and he didn't radiate heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if nothing bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, lasting coolness showed that Russia's head of state forgot nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was outrageous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin parted and accused Ankara of being in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin of President Erdogan received the excuse he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed from a failed coup d "état of almost his office last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State television forecast low-priced fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the persistent resentment on the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is pitied, will benefit from the cool sentiment and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a matter of course a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" to me: two countries that feel violated and treated badly by the West and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference saying that they had not even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately refrained from answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian struggle - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking to one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing squad of staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years IVANOV was part of Putin's tightest confidence circle.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it says that without stating reasons, Putin ordered" "" "the release of Ivanovo from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the clerk and staff manager.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's main task to support your work as Head of State on bills of law and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has mysteriously woken Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidors Vladimir Putin and works as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "but despite the ridicule for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once toured as a potential president, once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - be trusting for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV started the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB National Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, since a third term of Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another coup d "état by Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensland crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "deck-blowers" "", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slant ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art by a truly epic proportion in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the Viadukt and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete uss for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viadukt is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Tricky because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - on each side they were only worrying a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "concept of action" "" "for the next council session." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the main point in the town hall is, as Bratmann says: "how to deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to grow at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development program, which will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann says:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions right now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, as Bratmann, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you offset the loss of more than 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">There will be 500 apartments alone by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be bought outgoing bindings from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price relationship.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck worthwhile</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside but rather prefer spending their free time with staring on screens has been plagued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go makes it all about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created for videogames in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers overlaid.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that can be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, they can be "captured" or "captured" via a screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of following people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes time" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumpy game perils that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Definitely brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast melted on Thursday to title and magnified the gap between herself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cap Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles shows on the floating beam during the solo multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman winning a multi-battle title and overall the fifth, while consolidating her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning both gold and silver in the single multi-fight inale of women at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during its long way to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is attuned to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and trained by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight to the gym, trained in Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since summer 2013, it has lost no more competition for competition, a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although Mustafa was slightly tilted by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Brigbeam and boom-urns - in which Biles holds the world champion title - lurk.</seg>
<seg id="28">She caught up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and set one on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure form of formality - and tears streamed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team captain named" "" "Grandma" "" "by the Americans had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her tillage she knocked the audience to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana compelled the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large-scale floods after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards agreed that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared the requests for flood, boats and sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the commune of Tangipahoa would have requested tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood early warning system was used on Friday, while it was still raining in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a river-downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfav River, south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>

<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-son were among those who were rescued by Gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that Beaver Creek waters, which are usually located more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer could have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they stayed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flood had" "" "spread rapidly" "" "as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer close to Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning was 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground has been completely sucked by the rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an orderly in Tangipahoa sends 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches which were now inundated.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present to myself under the women's Olympic Games in Turnen and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three female gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Roman Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts has been an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and praised America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-event event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this kind of sport, but we do not see trainers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Final Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four turners in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like Turnen is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily in private gymnastics that are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the congregations aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gymnastics exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TRC for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnasts in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth top-quality gymnasts that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted for a vote rejected him.</seg>

<seg id="4">The first resident doctors are expected to have a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care at unassailable times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistants, announced last night in a statement: "Assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and will administer it to address all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com might make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Union in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you approach you from the back then you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the firing line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then bend his knee into the bar and twist the weapon from his hands while the attacker falls into pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the barrel and move backwards while they turn the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, store the weight on the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip, before they move backwards and turn the gun on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and worms of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a sink of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object, he used a luminary to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the sink of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he left behind, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to railway stations to washing-up buttons of toilets, the task turned his immune system down definitively to a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said," "" "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial painting showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their Luminometer was more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands had one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the tour film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have heard in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuormaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how they are linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film's direction, added: "let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had directed to him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping inspectors.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the Parliament elections will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupid than to date it is not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaigners, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers traveling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a local, so don't vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition there are practical problems: during the holidays helpers can hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count voices in the end, only rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="9">Up to the 4th of September 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to let the people pass by just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how much newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition- dusty.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age, and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spread the roses and chatted a little with the people, just as he did his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you're in the right place in the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale meetings; Merkel parliament's circle is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation in the village has eased.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to breakthroughs in them, everyone you ask can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="36">Instead, retired District Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner about whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts where something has been handled more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family-run business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love boards.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the commentary piece, to sow it under the pseudonym non-Allemonwealth men of the Middle ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the manifold reformation of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to embrace the newness of physical objects, but to middlelife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbies - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers always retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and run wild before I stick, hold my hands and say something better: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I wrote by Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and once again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought I was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets to apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to fans of the record-revals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers picked up the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, of items that call for happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is so important to me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way of dealing spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flocked from a record store." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the news report I would probably look very worried as I smoother through a stack of Bossa nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently and said:" I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-quality.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the records, has a blower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer- and sextpacker pop instead of experimental jazz weeds from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strangely emptied, but wet psychic traumas are hard to find if one stands next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for several minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more a window-betrotter than a shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am pretending to smuggle the jeans in the pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who for a moment group around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send down to the depths of Soho, there's nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one who spends most of it on luxury items such as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research has shown that the results of yougov vote, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their Thursday tomorrow with the boomerang through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong host who stands above the shoulders of no middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 tentative businesses in which people sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressers, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed measurers: in various federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident zones, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that speed limits are met with a stationary speed car.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days in continuous measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be captured simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits and driving bans according to time, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in the Handling, Side-Stepping, back-back, line run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, a 15-man team would have been beaten in this form in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This canopy will hurt, but progress is astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had a wonderful start and had fun bouncing the GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. as if you ran into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, as Osea Kolinisau smiled in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A ringing Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute vibrating jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the revival and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pushed through other weak Tactics of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still there.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went off for a long time in favor of the South African sultan, whose fans sang flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame replaced the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked crammed into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race at a tight half-finals - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown pushed the Boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a score among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no worse gold than with those games and that will mean what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard chieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an extra note in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was there when she rowed to the second Olympic Champion in a two-man without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th impromptu operation, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that was the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>

<seg id="1">STAHL - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Condition in the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach the tough negotiations after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to ask the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission following talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy is 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this would not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">So the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with regard to our campaign" "" "Steel is the Future" "", "this is a first step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "more must follow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "even in the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, in view of the weakening domestic demand China threw masses on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers introduce price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties imposed on import steel are effective, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "last but not least, prices would have stagnated again." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp decided not to shut down individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, such as the Steel Industry Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced crowd went back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing seniors do good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she took the course of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sang in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, described Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thanks to regular connections, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to meet and to organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, Seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly challenges his lungs does not get out of the puste in everyday life either.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people who suffer from dementia are sinking back to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to concentrate on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people, who live alone, practice so as not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced through singing in the choir, meaning Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem increases also through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I look for something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">On the search for the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone is singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="3">They have suffered cuts and have been treated at the hospital, but I have already been able to leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether the further explosions on the vacant island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this regard, the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities, such as snugs.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Thursday evening, around 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, Hua Hin exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Friday morning two explosions went up again, and another man was killed by the authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation near the beach of Patong who was popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured following police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed an urban worker.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities in a flower shop, the explosives had gone into the air in front of the Revier of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, some detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast, as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast claimed several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombings bear the same hand," "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express possible motives - but most likely it is the acts of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern which is typical of the Muslim separatists "bombings in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have received secret evidence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombs, but most of the time it is not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used over the years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "after the bombastic explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and environs.</seg>
<seg id="30">After conflicts between the security forces and the Muslim populations, travelling to these provinces is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, has profited itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebellious revolt of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok in a stop at a popular Hindu shrine, 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's younger history.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not straight athletic figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why is the 24-year-old participating in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming pool.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable, when he had to take over 100 metres of free-style in a run-up.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fee per cubic meter of wastewater will amount to 2.10 euros from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl, 3.44 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to now 2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf €3.64 (up to now 2,18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a sluggish calculation, the wastewater fee in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Kulmbach District Council established that there were undercoverings for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities at a cost-covering level.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">Revenue increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and / or undercoverings from the preceding calculation period can be equaled.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt therefore reasoned the serious fee increases by relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste water, which ranges between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculation, all three plants were not least appreciable due to their age of rehabilitation and repair expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welzel, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater system.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welzel had to be overhauled from the ground up to almost 20 years and the first sewage treatment plant Lopp had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were" "" "fully smashed" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs for the wastewater facilities has remained spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain precarious in the view of stone houses in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sanitation association cannot be extended by these facilities, because these facilities are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as an Asian cartoonist</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unbridled, property-turning tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriage returns to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When a filter suggested a filter this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat said it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism have reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail grace Sparapani, a Korean-American student whose tweets were widespread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and the least said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filtering effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-secured, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the discarded extremism.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more than their older opponents - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters a picture that insults for a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided to work as Product Manager and Engineer to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military Guidelines Verdict Daesh intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command have modified intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when the actual conditions on site were allowed, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces, Secret Service Committees and Armed Forces Commites, reports of great discontent under Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, near Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information provided by high-ranking Centcom commissions regularly drew a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts face the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were significantly more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom representative publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">The second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called Task Force to live after they were ascribed to the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense's general inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff Representative House, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the morals among analysts and" "" "given excessive space for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a white house intervention at the Centcom analysts with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the Congress proceedings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector who received complaints from Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigators of the General inspector were still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermediaries of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward only to a small occupying army in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put in operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature due to his excessive positive appraisal of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>

<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way the other group leads.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising vortex during their success story, four years after they ended up at the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we have the rudder to pull around completely." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back-stroke from the near-area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the American a 2-0 lead.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surrounded by the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a rapid relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is handed from the wrist protection to the float to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these known names sent to prime time, built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swim and may it prevail for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have enough arguments for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so sparsely perceived that many of them, I questioned, didn't know that it was a kind of Olympic Port at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had had an athlete that made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clowns school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the spanish El Trampoline, meaning as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Upcoming winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, piping and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympiad, you will be assessed according to the version, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists have to go farther, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also in the television broadcast another high goal: the world or the Olympic Capital.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel to be somewhat tiring while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spruce and objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Nonviolent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shake the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed eighty unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests which are probably the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or pushed into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which in recent years have been forced more or less, to exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of warping under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies who hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians told them that they were assembled as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons, the Amharas, who are mainly Christian high-nationals from Äthopiens, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are about coordinating under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death on an unpublished sickness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil was in 2005 after thousands protested against elections, seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, led by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray became increasingly common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenberg flights over the neighboring Somalia, although she recently announced that she closed this base." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama had formed ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raises new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along its comrades who endeavour to take care of it during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that it could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest, the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the allegation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down to Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling cargo values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were talking to the business situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained "Of course I thought that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic limits in politics and then rude if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more causal tone as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he emphasises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave himself great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it ammunitions, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by aggressively taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he mocked the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trumps apology as only a further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenlanhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark on the bottom of the North Atlantic along, in one hour it comes on average just 1,220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates to a lush 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle inspired by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">By Felix F. Seidler. Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy, University of Kiel, Germany and runs the site Seidlers Sicherheitspolitik. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein, from the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionbiologist believed long ago that Greenland sharks are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live above all in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-slow-pentecos measured them, when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver, which torpedoes from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland sharks who took fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, its birth was supposed to lie in the atmosphere of producing large amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere as a search for nuclear weapons.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the third smallest animal in the length of the third smallest animal, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, which should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">In contrast, all major Greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 levels in their lens core, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record sharks with 502 centimetres should be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined by 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously have at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methusalies live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 year old harpoon tip was stuck, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the interest in Russian companies has grown strongly in businesses in the country, the ambassador said.</seg>

<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports in Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Mini-strants from the soul care unit Eglantal-Haigerloch (St. Anna) were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were completed.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Romspilgrimage of all the ministrants in the next two years, the Oberministrant round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided to visit the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, the gate of mercy opened at the Freiburg cathedral was a special pilgrimage destination.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruole, Haigerloch, and Holy chambers, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">The evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration, blessed the pilgrimage and parted the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a cathedral of Our Lady was standing and so the Pilgrim Path came from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis returned to field crossings, chapels and churches again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish halls of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller care for a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped onto the stage after St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but had to drop some 500 metres in altitude during the heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the beach in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy the Minis met in the late afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God thanked God with a little impulse.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, the Minis of the Co-operator Markus Obert were welcomed at the Pilgrim's goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was still time for the city of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor he had made his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy. the yacht made the legend haughty when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place in London in March despite the re-entry Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a sign up.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner prevailed in the qualifying laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was slightly back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and give me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round, we set up an Olympic champion and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinds admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said Hinder:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has been won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bike stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "said Hinder:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was arguing with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to compete for his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Despite, Joanna Rowell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the mid period of the Olympic Games and to get a shot of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background drama played out in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director, in April, surrounded by sexism and bulging arrangements, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium meltdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workingworkmen - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy established for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be endowed with closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting pot consumes about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Schmelzer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, most recently, due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium shale with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scorched reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clattering plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a TV station at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the region of Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendalls's big sister Kim loves her as far as the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (aut Fashionista have been advertising from the 832 pages of the company's 615 page advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still permeated before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years, there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that are modeled" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities are" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the small chance that Mrs Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to celebrities or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success does not appeal to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners has always been somewhat tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mithers of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled down again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But looking around on the grimity seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's aid agencies are averted annually by the municipal law centers, while the industry insists on the impact of further mid-cuts on already overloaded transactions.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Queensland there are already three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unjust delogivings and similar - in their seeking for free legal advice and legal assistance.</seg>

<seg id="5">As of June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>

<seg id="7">Farrell said that without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government, the situation would only get worse.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have envided similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly moved forward.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect against evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also profited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously assumed by planet researchers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are associated with planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope to find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cluster of the Pleiades cluster lies 445 light years distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated about 125 million years ago, reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">To peak rotational rates, these maturing stars hit large amounts of star-winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the stars of the stars, they have a brake effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aging, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more solid stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Sternenhaufen of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes" so to speak.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An experienced athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping events took place in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle runner, Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Chen had already demonstrated the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Criminal Court, CAS, confirmed the exclusion of the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also during the night of Rio, the news irritated the positive rehearsal at Dangerova, the 33-year-old went on to the offensive himself.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing malware are currently using targeted businesses - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebyte under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwareblue to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be blackmailed falls considerably higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebyte CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered blackmail software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it selectively searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail press.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptoise Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies affected sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break down their business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrator's demand in view of standstill in operation." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims by chatting how they can pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must sometimes negotiate with hard bargaining and pay five-digit amounts to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, says Security Expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been developed so that malware, consulting and additional tools have been purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Presses are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the ground, buy the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will be made per authenticated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of companies IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be able to defend ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebyte CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damages, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the alarm clock no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, there are such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Influency and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you normally understand, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhaling and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just feeling sleepy many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in case of depression," "" "says Wealth." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can lie poorly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to brood over everyday problems and worries, Weeks is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I become a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is no shortage of sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why sleeping problems should first be addressed to the family doctor, she advises Kris.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in case of snoring with breathers, for example, in case of snoring with breathing propositions, in case of sickness, for sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fietze explains.</seg>

<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he scored gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has turned over to his ex-team-mate in front of his ex-team-mate.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner gets €20,000 bonus and a jungle king of 150,000 €should no one be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden brooks, in between a rest of the cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first sight, but the police are one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">After passing the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks, however, with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator Henkel died several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "No-go zones" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadorschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, patrols the police three weeks of official statement, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers pulled off the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who lives here three children, are mostly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez that mostly wants police protection against the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police between house staffs and their neighbors, obviously don't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which also today has a low average income and high poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under heavy police command in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electors from around the world in recent years: with them, residents of East Germany and former domestic occupiers share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on discarded disks or newly painted facades that have been discarded with dyes.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily concerned about crime: crimes such as body injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes make property damage, which tend to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lived for 17 years in a rented house next to the disputed 94, uncertainty cannot be mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: the people of the 94 are their neighbours, they have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly stressed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: faceless newbuildings in former buildings that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, they are condominiums, which are not interesting for many of us here, rather people who are not so well cared for," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For newcomers who are angry about color bombs Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who go there should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee agency</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee agency for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group points out that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschy is now there, the eiving woolen purse, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant some - less ridiculing rather than the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job out.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, just an apprenticeship in Wollmelchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine's client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are located in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connection refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves have to bear the costs of building, rent or renovating these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Land Registry Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it doesn't work, except for private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">For this reason, common apartments have to be reconditioned as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be erected in the Wassenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and backup activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more seats would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community will lead to positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and mainly language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here are administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it is just taking time to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivating.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problem cases too, says customer honestly, "People that do nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are they afraid of radicalization after the recent occurrences, also in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly," "" "what some may pretend to be naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">However, the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also the subject of the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would make them complete.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "therefore, main and honorary officials must look for activities locally and in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question is clearly to be answered, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to spot them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been used to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
