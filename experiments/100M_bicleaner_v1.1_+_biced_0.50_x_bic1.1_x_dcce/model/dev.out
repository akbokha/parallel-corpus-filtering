Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as on Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement of Israel and propos@@ ing Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal raised by Obama about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting was rejected with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girlfriend has shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ st and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he has shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency call at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
a day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motiv@@ ating Lamb .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ st died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended classes of both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university employment policy mean that the promotion , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would have no guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb himself killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ tone , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a bath in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ st , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ st when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail rose three years ago both in a summer market .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ st Night at night 5 September last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar programme and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Brown also participated in the watch vi@@ gil , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his distress call was called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plan to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to employ 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees rises from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated lens and a measuring length of it , with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN chief ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey figures show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks near p@@ olls , it has ( still ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the rising star Cain , none of whom even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tru@@ mp@@ s per@@ sever@@ ance and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their scholars , republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten are saying that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on je@@ b Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot;
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ can re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination over only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters watch Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp almost kills everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tru@@ mp management while anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ ap@@ ing majority support .
before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , he has 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans are saying they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp are saying that they have strongly for@@ given their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago , called &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; immigrants from Mexico , was the immigration turning and fishing point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial Hez@@ bollah Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as immigration in the li@@ mel@@ ight remains , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anger . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ look@@ er weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt .
in the street one square meter of a home country house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences , with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top right here .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double tor@@ shake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the Champions League in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich finally in the third race .
Müller received a good help from the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 3@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his latest six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went gra@@ c@@ efully , but often in@@ im@@ lessly to work with their aggressive efforts .
the attacks were often introduced by player reloc@@ ation to left @-@ left Douglas Costa , who rarely crossed the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ gl@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field on the left upper door@@ way .
in the 6@@ 7th minute World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
at first , as the Olympic champi@@ on@@ storm , Ide@@ a Brown hit the poles of the poles from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct use , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their habit@@ ual domin@@ ance , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set need@@ les .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so , for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola put a square chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports manager Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone wanting something else is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
the i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , mil@@ ler put a mil@@ ler on it .
in front of the game , the stadium came to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ ed Bavaria @-@ fans obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with striking sticks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : ren@@ oun@@ cing the risk quickly decreases .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.7 to 3.6 times .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , stresses the di@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val infections in smokers .
it is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the threat comes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , &quot; explains Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of Birmingham England University .
one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good oral health up to high age .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble onto remnants of the late Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have dug out , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Resources .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists now found it .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , Trier explained .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 tom@@ bs had been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the proposed Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is said to be the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work on an international investment dish according to his own data .
there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Disp@@ ute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , mainly demanded by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to acquire compensation of tax pa@@ yers , budgets out national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act stated that the European Commission &apos;s proposals were inadequate .
above all , it was critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the Trade Agreement negotiated with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account key points in the reform that German Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU @-@ Commerce ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business Europe warned against limiting the business of the economy through too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , investor protection has not been discussed with the US yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;

delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , which reports his min@@ u@@ zi@@ bly and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be wonderfully creative .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear wis@@ ely composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously cop@@ ing with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a disc@@ arded series : each of the 50 US states should be followed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is published in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sales pieces .
this sixth record studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs dis@@ mounted , the show shows are here for the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ band bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark red Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although now nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens moved clearly to the in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet basically away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only for an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens would like to thank St@@ ev@@ ens and acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and then bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gran@@ ce of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Fra@@ gran@@ ce of the Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly awaited since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will make his debut at the Fra@@ gran@@ ce of the Prime Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the region .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the centre of several newspaper pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesperson said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; irrespective of &quot; their belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC , Robin Bran@@ t , says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acked &quot; within Labour , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference was to present Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of limiting altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth member of the Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised another article , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from tac@@ kling serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will represent him if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy @-@ Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the PM was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and his leadership in the House of Represent@@ atives and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound was boun@@ cing forward according to data that indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s pay@@ roll growth . in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom rose by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most experienced assessments on the date of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offering of Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again report growth .
shares of Glen@@ core increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the athletes had reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor cost of his company , he says .
the costs could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on Bi@@ eber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
&lt; b &gt; There is no information available for this album yet !
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
more even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 is spinning .
like Wik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the construction of the be@@ aver : here you see i@@ dol , whose poster hangs on St@@ et@@ tin since Monday evening .
the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to pay for school ?
who does it itch ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
he has taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the Super Sale , he received three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , donated a lot of dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber concentr@@ ates likewise .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is astonished at the wind@@ shield .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others emphasize that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - in the potato shop , which the Oldenburg I@@ mb@@ tear owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he saw accidentally on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there has been a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
therefore , Al@@ hay wants not to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes are in the sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ a starts resistance campaign to fight al@@ di@@ ac disease
met@@ a is trying to protect the IG@@ A branch from an Al@@ di March in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ a has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , metal and IG@@ A supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IG@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers boun@@ ce on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough who distri@@ butes samples in IG@@ A stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that further details of its defense strategy will be published on September 29 when the wholes@@ aler carries out its annual investors strategy day for food , alcohol and equipment .
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s IG@@ A retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s IG@@ A network in eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley , however , believe that after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all available players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that IG@@ A @-@ retailer could lose 360 million turnover per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ amor@@ oso loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business dinner in Melbourne that metal cash probably will disappear within a decade .
cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Metal@@ workers has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trading , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operative debt reduction in terms of turnover and margins .
however , the wholesale dealer den@@ ies and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to deliver IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ a &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ g@@ gen and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the li@@ mel@@ ight by the in@@ famous fight of Cy@@ ril with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison saying : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beat Cy@@ ren@@ gen , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp@@ f left a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is of He@@ aly was still defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a bit too severe .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly did not take into consideration the decision to take into consideration the decision to take into consideration the important decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ g@@ gen &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
the people fle@@ eing from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the fron@@ tier ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian defense police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unken Italy and Greece . they expressed hope that eventually - the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a concer@@ ted action by Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency exit scheduled for Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and speed asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees who are looking for a better life and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence building the government along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes against the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday , following a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .

another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit lead in the Democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is in favour of the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ency of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some gains .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections decreased .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points back .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents less than 50 years has pl@@ under@@ ed , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton had a two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als against S@@ anders , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nation@@ ally say they would support Clinton when they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t support Clinton at the moment - just about a quarter would support it enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Vice President throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for the prim@@ aries , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decided not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage against S@@ anders is increased , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much like last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these prim@@ aries is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important features with voters of the pre @-@ elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
the democratic constitu@@ tions of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being questioned during the term of office as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their views altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their overall Clinton opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still deterior@@ ating .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated from Clinton .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country see also Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good marks for leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honestly , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son draws close to Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp throughout the country . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes tru@@ mp under republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest point , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % in third place .
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support in the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son asc@@ ending in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for tru@@ mp the tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
at the same time , swimming temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College no@@ vice
almost two years after a student died during a sham@@ anic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood seized Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared with him .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with associated eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack loaded with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and , in principle , perpet@@ u@@ ated the welfare of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , den@@ g was repeatedly inflic@@ ted with dul@@ ler strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of false attacks and education of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be accoun@@ table to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rate of interest is coming , and the house se is going to sink , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when it comes to raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have emphasized so strongly that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of an interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency to add assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases .
more precisely , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , Head of Strate@@ gic Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ell later on in the rising cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that have not existed before and could speed up a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants enjoyed an interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le since the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond pockets are falling inst@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates leads to a closer link between shorter and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that Jones believes that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have wi@@ dened and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and large scale , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit from this when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial rate of interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollar .
savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MEP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also allu@@ ded to the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ boss that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from his commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seems - I don &apos;t like to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also allu@@ ded to the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director denied the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I really think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er should be worked to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport to kick off commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is the next time an entertainment series starts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the ordering from further ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased by slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible

experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ its itself , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year five times the average number of buyers scored for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers fought because of bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was spent a little over £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in a crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are worn by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly lays down the breakdown of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque .
mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the track to pay tribute to their respect when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the mour@@ ning procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building ran through the mosque &apos;s ceiling and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial when the Saudi King imposed a san@@ ction over the Bin Laden family &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mo@@ cha of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stand when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
earlier this week Sal@@ man was to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that fell into a large mosque courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later this month , gathered .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal decree also t@@ apped the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mosque as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been united with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an ab@@ u@@ sive son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people remained hospit@@ alized .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other los@@ ers receive half of this amount .

by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its put down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can b@@ ypass skil@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British employ increasingly professional tra@@ des@@ men to perform job @-@ to @-@ do jobs in their homes , according to the company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans and close 60 sales outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and donations .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of mis@@ use .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the tor@@ ney @-@ prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ zed that the def@@ endants were used for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of fund accounts in their functions .
he cited the damage at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial years .
this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that there was no asset in the association at any time .
sports officials had only charged expense allowance and carried out the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the def@@ endants said , in the bread@@ making profession of the Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have borrowed money to secure our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the takeover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in the case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense reimbur@@ sement had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
that is why one part of the expense damage was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and not detailed bus@@ h@@ ings appeared , the former Ob@@ mann described the events .
the accounts and pass@@ books managed the two def@@ endants together , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial expenditure , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in the year 2011 against which a function@@ ary investigation began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ endants said .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this directive was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ endant ple@@ aded that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never covered a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and diets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to diets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ endants were unable to present accurate documents for the early years .
after an audit where everything was judged as correct , they were no longer kept , they declared .
the second def@@ endant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
all the exercises are done in cash , in addition , he has to drive from his home town of international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;

as a result , costs of EUR 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the dis@@ assembly of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .

in the third quarter of the financial year , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police has deployed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water lights against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k experienced the violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :

behind the police , a police line had formed and a water @-@ thro@@ wer was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially set up mint spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now res@@ igned . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest has been raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half the F@@ ed would do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the null area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , managing employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that chances are good against such a step .
the decision will be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death schüt@@ z at Delta State University dec@@ eased ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ annon Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I &apos;m sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency center that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give it .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ st , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ st also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ st have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ st was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ st .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he won &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when police took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate from Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life @-@ lau indicates on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the Group .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and enhancing the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the low cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future , CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings by Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt .
with this innovation Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
up to now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120 000 employees has been very complex .
the flight lines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the pilots association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
this divided the union .
the topic of the talks shall be the retirement arrangements for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa has moved to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own low @-@ cost line in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defense to cry and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bass and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then that lasts for six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a cub@@ it and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico viol@@ ated Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad with it . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron is familiar with The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long until you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental bill released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the subsequent paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book , instead gives an index of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to bro@@ aden the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ér@@ ard @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel read and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron partially reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ér@@ v@@ v where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , th@@ ole stri@@ kers , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax twenty times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s election circle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , mos@@ ques Ali develops as spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th goes out of the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago he would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully beats more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get so good performance , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he &apos;s above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first entered Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I include highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire more early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very well .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the deployment of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques has perhaps not done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred ranks right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it &apos;s ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy arrives in a dol@@ drums until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equi@@ vocal ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive changes in treaty that they mostly do not want are full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European friend , who wants to see a Great Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers may even deliberately not have helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not in 1975 when they were inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , who supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ an &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
in all his cra@@ z@@ iness Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ nationals , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her but determined that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having dinner and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum campaign because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never with@@ drew from it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on his back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the eigh@@ ties , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but it must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sof@@ as he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position in Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wil@@ dest realms of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs were fighting in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ uties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron any free card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege @-@ Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fundam@@ ental Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month laid the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to bring their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director had previously been awarded by British American Tob@@ acco Product ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding , which he was supposed to have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes Champions , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting was also attended by the P@@ he tobacco director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ ographi@@ cally lists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes should serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to have long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually at a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System $ 2 billion per year .
by telling current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we carry out our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former leader of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson dem Ober@@ haus @-@ Kommunik@@ ations @-@ Committee during his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I think medium or long term does not hold for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or put into commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , admitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC altogether .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts on BBC show this again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they &apos;re going to justify their hypo@@ critical missions to justify $ 4 billion in broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson told the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course you think all , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 a lot , I wonder if this is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educate , educate and maintain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and entertaining &quot; at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and deal with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound samples .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment when they have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , be@@ amed .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically altered to wear the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms presented the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect the structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones .
the procedure has some similarities to op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : take from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the font types of London Underground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence around the advertisement for the fair - through a blank of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they played with the invention of realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; by blu@@ ff@@ ing with bright colours and animation it stays stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es from Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors captiv@@ ate fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences reaches from slightly nerve @-@ canc@@ elling up to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to talk about : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because seriously , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people who you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , movie nights venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble culture , which can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos t@@ apping : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by ja@@ ws .
as you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome from the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats are a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when they knock .
ste@@ aling the food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a washing @-@ up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the true sense of the pro@@ verb it belongs to the people sitting in the glass @-@ house .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbors to make a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbors kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day , and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his non @-@ closed room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never disp@@ ose someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ ro@@ omed , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate contractor , Markus Gil@@ dner , builds terra@@ ced houses in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner has believed to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here to a large extent here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough housing in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated is the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l ordin@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subordin@@ ated who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built luxury apartments which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good even today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may be the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to delete the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch to half way and this could lead to a break @-@ off of the update .

district office looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new focal point at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consulting , you can also attend courses there .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , you will receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as care insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for years we have been diagnosed with our out@@ patient nursing service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone .
there are an infinite number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of insur@@ ances is barely understood , the new land@@ lady Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ istic and Ci@@ tiz@@ enship , as well as for out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the new land@@ lady Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , it is possible to use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior management centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both executives especially in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration celebrations , dedic@@ ate the district office also to the unification of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ operation . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and on Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the altitude of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the petrol station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed for the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the aid of a stick @-@ stick , one examined on the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
so far , there is only one v@@ ague task description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires practical field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor of Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel rock breaks are reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us straße 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first glance , when the ri@@ vals met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently undergoing specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to get into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact to patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to dwell in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time father Frank Müller also grew up , followed his medical studies in Hannover , in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged honorary in the DRC willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 onwards , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be settled as home doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the computer is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros will be given to the garbage collectors as part of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ t@@ ville @-@ mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks in every quarter , in the North German average , approximately 500 patients are employed .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another family practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
if no follow@@ er had found herself , she would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hour also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the rock walls .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel rock breaks reminis@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly happened after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are reached on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make a request for asylum must also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
in this way , the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian does not want to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Cro@@ at police could attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly been meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it is it that people are wise to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day more buses were expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border around Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary joined us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could indeed come to a slightly further west@@ ward route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non @-@ Schengen member , has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good record to the country since it comes to the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local ticket in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature birth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee numbers at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous , however : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock market h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who is accused of having provided insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der shops have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other def@@ endants in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ ying life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big pla@@ ques each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary and is well confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as to questions and talks like the volunteers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously grab@@ s the chal@@ k and adds the sentence to &quot; affir@@ ming my life , &quot; others can read , &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , speak sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet , &quot; and then go on .
at the same time , small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Association carriers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this public effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets , but it is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .

when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking honorary citizenship by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was there during the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and their families in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes and hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences made here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ p , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 cut
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in Pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the increase in price increases , the average overall view is 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sales for bo@@ d@@ water sports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase in comparison with the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues and because of the growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday occupation were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted T@@ ack Investment Research &apos;s twelve analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks ordered analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments which brought sales in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the Lei@@ tz@@ in for the first time since almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is threatening over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story cour@@ tro@@ om .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US jobs and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives sc@@ ary to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate rise this week .
however , financial markets expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial gar@@ ner@@ ed an average of 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was caused by expectations that the F@@ ed policy su@@ stains the proposition this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rate of interest would calm financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
another month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to raise the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress in the spring and early summer , expecting an increase in the sentence .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wage increases have shown signs of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world arrived at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , with Dow falls almost 10 % below May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; their monetary expansion , resolved del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , claimed this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements , which apparently is not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates interest rate , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia helped the F@@ ed down 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability to the first place only during a serious crisis such as the re@@ unification of 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate policy .
the youngest turbul@@ ence come not close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rate of interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 loung@@ es .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the very different teaching is rather than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pon@@ di@@ at@@ onic Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization , SP@@ RS , tries in a sho@@ cking way to educate women about how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ckle on breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy eating of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction entry for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn @-@ on building on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent Community Meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously voted without great discussions .
among other things , the Board had previously decided on an application for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid cultivation plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ bearing first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which was supposed to lie under ten degrees for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan concerning the a@@ eg@@ ulation does not permit any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually acts more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a recur@@ rent project for the rever@@ ber@@ ation building : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ astic building at the sports centre is a joint project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated on costs .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots support .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the Land Registry for Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß affir@@ med .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all the nearly 50 staff would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should reloc@@ ate with Fischer and the further inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to travel to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who is to follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years Fischer will work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses until next year the former hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will finally be closed after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
the Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with ru@@ mo@@ urs that the house , owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ ap@@ ark , will be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property goes on , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer commenting on the qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
in recent decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Ba@@ ths at Bh@@ c got a painful defeat and got a good chance there .
hunting guy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their maize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( County Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police communicated .
after a cast , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear how exactly it could have happened to the accident .
the det@@ ective police determined .
miss 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is deemed to be suspect , who indicated the fact that the investig@@ ator was in charge of the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after attending an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not as agreed .
in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially ble@@ w on the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the arrest was reported to the authorities in the police court to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought forward on Wednesday to the Haf@@ dener , the investig@@ ators put an end to his burden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the immediate circumstances of the act shall bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
distribution conflicts on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
thus 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented flats .
according to the Statisti@@ sches Bundes@@ amt ( Statisti@@ sches Bundes@@ amt ) last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently some 70@@ ,000 living units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many occup@@ ations therefore lived in large cities in emergency with WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives are to revi@@ ve social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax on land transfer tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats could be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary , according to the Alliance .
the funding program for refugee accommodation by the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the around 300 million euros had already been declared on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free rein : Croatia and Slovenia lead a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no passing through , because more and more refugees choose their way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing a trip through Slovenia to the North with no hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , are also practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and with Ta@@ xen to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately upon arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not at the border f@@ ences .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before closing gate on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the new &quot; transit zones &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers must be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers begin to clean up .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side .
the barrier gr@@ ates were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees reach Austria .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the mess when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany was surprisingly prepared for rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , however , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first su@@ cked the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we take them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train towards Passa@@ u . after the announcement of the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , it was still possible to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was turned off from the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , day before , a double @-@ brid@@ ged run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately to establish structures that ensure humanity , our chan@@ cell@@ or publicly and publicly tra@@ ded the position of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze of National Socialism .
not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lived land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge in the face of the persistent flow of refugees and the approaching winter , in which we produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant neighbour@@ hoods
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do with the underground delivery of all hands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has a weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to create quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first inspection centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ el@@ essness in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without a great host , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master@@ y . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ eland year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the federal government , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had discussions with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him , also to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atory is supporting Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations also in the ORF @-@ Aktion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to maintain a certain height of the towel rack or size of the tran@@ som .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry , that he is more successful in placing an accommodation , Konrad is reas@@ sured with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the Republic as they declared themselves .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
so far our own search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as we are currently unable to accommodate those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism of the city chief is committed to the distribution of refugees inside the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday dra@@ fted further action on the issue of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , the corresponding border controls now exist .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the guards were brought to Germany with regular trains .
from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT company S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wor@@ ship@@ yard and later also to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2,@@ 700 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus .
Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to de@@ fer the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she gained further growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most excited when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the specialist can not answer with the latest security .
perhaps it is due to a beautiful bag of every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for excit@@ ers .
whether he expresses himself xen@@ opho@@ bia , journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office t@@ wir@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants area are related to it over -@@ zig .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the director Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter Art , &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says .
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring , which apart from Tru@@ mp is also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
thus , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of investors .
the success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the real estate group &apos;s foundations were the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed by the Bavarian State , at which the Pfalz were at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ onic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal migrant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote converted Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retired minister sees the Americans more distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always so er@@ ron@@ eous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension whi@@ r@@ l Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated a visit to the church organ at a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he did not know the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ cher Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp has been interviewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ as , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavaria municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in neighbouring countries , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the reviews for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was be@@ amed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international television shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to have no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today achieved a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number fell short of the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , Today , the gap to the Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today , Today .
at the beginning of the year the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are ok , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 5 : 00 p.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , attracted 44@@ 6,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ seed will finally prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that managed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may have accidentally made an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a per@@ ver@@ end who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and saw ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood are well suited as pairs .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood was &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally hired on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the b@@ achel@@ or will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 hrs .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle demonstrated great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches had banned Hay@@ ne from the Bank for the rest of the game when he lost a don@@ ka as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t did during his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a reinforced Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Free V@@ oters will be in the Fran@@ con@@ ian community until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for refugees in Syria , as they did during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Independent Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to push free voters away as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum @-@ suits : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critici@@ zed that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria stri@@ ves , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long lasting torch remains on the order of the day : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; ( Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch ) .
but that is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 needs to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums who want to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the force erup@@ ted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , Head of District Inves@@ tig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside of a police station , some of them threw rocks and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ war@@ ms .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ war@@ ks used , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ brid@@ i say that new provinces formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week in favour of certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution would enter into force on Sunday .

the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
violent reactions among mer@@ cen@@ aries , who had come to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the hor@@ semen and board member at the stak@@ eholder representation of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears some other project critics that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ loads must come to make it profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling @-@ donations campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ up campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ ze the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / amounted to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has been proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the diabetes largely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood levels reflecting blood sugar levels over time .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mortality in five years , according to the researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the hosp@@ itali@@ zation group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher return in the BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obesity was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take it seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently attracting more attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to reflect on how the killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent reaction of the US followed a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children less than twelve years of age who swal@@ lowed strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in need of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers report@@ edly have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think it &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can cause alcohol pois@@ oning especially for infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , Medical Director of the Po@@ ison@@ emergency Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cl@@ ung her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond the intoxic@@ ation of alcohol , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities suspect that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the 4th grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the vain plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was refused by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es down Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I am going to turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by a 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly the way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y during January transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago , indicating that he made some of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mik@@ u with retreat
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mik@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could reti@@ re when his contract exp@@ ires with the sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a sick@@ le kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have commented upon no performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le , if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ en@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things over - but it is clear that the decline in the field must end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get the guys back on a tro@@ t again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that Aber@@ deen &apos;s crew had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league win , which gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , which games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom in the same period rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent above the U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland declined by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken interfer@@ ed with the process

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , there is a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you will get access .
I commend myself to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I &apos;ve said and written .
he tells me not what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong chance is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can turn .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .
man after a damp police ch@@ ase , persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called into Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the race
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Racing Victoria &apos;s ste@@ wards tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media has always tried to do what is best for racing and he has found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat down for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before that , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart stayed in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the view that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say now lets them think about it right now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels were based on the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching provided that he said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the failed Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the hor@@ semen , which was contrary to the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my associates er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it would have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after driver cur@@ sed arrest

the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy kno@@ cks back against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations of ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the NR@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a scarcely concealed comment to the Storm team after his crew achieved final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ering of his crew and said that they were concentrating only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team would be confident , as they were worried they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ ing when they beat us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have not changed our defensive system or techni@@ cs . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ x a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent is there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not accustomed to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny as this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and don &apos;t points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team released this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee for Dru@@ gs
a man who might face a life sentence due to his attempt to take possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ length punishment for trying to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the threat of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars for security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ oun@@ ds his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , reported to the police daily and passed to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : the driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab is completely disman@@ tled .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours until 2 am .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g accepted the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , log@@ inn@@ ed into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of them and looked at the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , that he might be addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer of him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
according to the indictment , H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to viol@@ ate the obligations of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was ref@@ unded in this case but was kept in custody pending hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ users caused fear of discovery and arrest the people increased to smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ age guns to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal police and forwarded to the registration .
according to the Federal Police , the Munich central station made a significant increase in the number of refugees on Wednesday compared to the weekly start of the week .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : clu@@ stering of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure region over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the masses are doing it : every two years the car builders at the International Motor Show are showing their innovations .
2015 is especially noticeable in the compact car , which currently sells particularly well .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Maritime Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new top class and luxury cars , many new compact models are introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel makes an entry under the biggest competitor of VW Golf , which will start at € 17@@ 650 .
the current Astra costs 16,@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
furthermore , the Hessen also offers other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ lined sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan out@@ board wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .

Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
on the outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er placed first hand on the front part : the radi@@ ator grill was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was upgraded , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the rear @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison institution Te@@ gel , who was lod@@ ged for months in a too small cell .
because of the violation of her human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court decision in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges may even hope for money if they were confined in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a solitary cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , is now on a free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell .
in spite of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin , his office of office failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges lifted the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention would be decisive for the compensation , it was said that there was no compensation for compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ ding the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al now has to clarify the amount of the compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they said only in April a prisoner of compensation because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to man un@@ worthy , a decision of 2011 is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Court of Justice , which had agreed a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was housed within three months between 15 to 21 hours in a homo@@ geneous cell like in the Car@@ ls@@ ru@@ her case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of junior staff , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties . every year , 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental price will fall out , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing each year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investing in residential construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by Felix F. Sei@@ dler . Felix is a fellow at the Institute for Security Policy , University of Kiel , Germany and runs the site Sei@@ d@@ lers Sicherheit@@ spolitik . &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , the asylum seekers confined to a place of residence .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore , according to th@@ ron@@ hardt , the king &apos;s way to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few sought @-@ after parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the de@@ wor@@ med parents , it is only once important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ inen , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for teachers to rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries students with no knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons without German language skills .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ eps from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Interior Minister Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law when they start studying .
the latter do not get a bar@@ g in principle , since they do not fall under the group of persons entitled to equality .
patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span can be shortened to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which professionally takes care of newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes a willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to extra@@ dite such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is becoming more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a short decade , an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law .
but it learns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organizations and interest groups of non @-@ white German are demanding for a long time , and what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism Convention Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the currently expected refugees , writes medical retired Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all the newcom@@ ers to sign up health cards right away .
rendered services could later be calculated with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier particularly difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are ill @-@ informed about their illnesses as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpreter costs should be taken over , she demands .
many refugees , however , have already been helped with more general medical reference points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated obstruc@@ tions , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
but with the partially different clinical pictures , German doctors come from their training , but clear , writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the don@@ or , possibly even relief in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege to dream of
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to capture every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal trainers and unique entertainment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the circus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invites to dream in the arena on the brick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the gift for enthusiasts is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the public with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily take up the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - these words identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Celeb@@ ration also fascin@@ ates with finger tips and jo@@ in@@ iness .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an it is not a problem .
snake people are fascinated and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mis@@ understand@@ ings in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents are enjoying every strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , is read by the eyes according to the possibility of each wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the highest priority is : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there is something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invites to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day from 17 to 20 September . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , came down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions of opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous threats of death and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the last month they had bu@@ cked him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which warned them to interfere with Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members that immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spokesperson said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will have up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will then split up in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its services business activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job reductions will result in a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP chair@@ person and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today is , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical plants and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the move from HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that closely focused businesses deliver better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb after the hurt Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly remain uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical perspective , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsenal &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last throughout the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb from the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is imag@@ ining a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it to get a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are going to pass through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal has drawn up the lessons of the previous season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from the far@@ away hope with its management to lead the association to its first European triumph@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked at arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that men hin@@ ders to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication , guided by social media , with its emphasis on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ funny and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominating .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work but by his personality , which sh@@ one by interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football shirts in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone pastoral council told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents quite clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the completely re@@ designed setting to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the whole 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration

di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball@@ ast in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A Paris requires a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities ahead of the gate . later he was replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even though there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I depl@@ ore that we did not score another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 oun@@ ces in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass beyond Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and past nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who defeated Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but except a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed close to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some failures and bad connections , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who was scrat@@ ched in the first half in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shoot that was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus achieved his sixth consecutive win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and for a short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacing replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi one gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by share sales
the mining giant Glen@@ core resident in Switzerland , who is affected by the collapse of raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale on Wednesday as part of his huge redemption plan .
the company Glen@@ core , registered in London , stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately € 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn reduces the demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of reference rights brought Glen@@ core stock exchange rate at retail early Wednesday morning to a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange .
the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Glen@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion stocks in the value of up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to approach areas of dis@@ agreements construc@@ tively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before moving to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi can address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns about China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber es@@ pi@@ onage and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champi@@ ons champion , four times champi@@ ons League winner , two times champion league champion , two times champion champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he already stood out of Barcelona before the EM 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds spread out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and ended the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown was interrupted , as this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity then do it in the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown shocked , with ab@@ u@@ sive un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian strengthened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer teams Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white stallion .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; in the end its directing &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 rescu@@ ets and 4.000 li@@ kes since its release .
women &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of social discussion .
after Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved national appeal and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to apply discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ sts invited to visit the pop@@ e to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and assistant Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition @-@ show , which just completed their 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the ar@@ du@@ ous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10.000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Britain , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any res@@ ent@@ ment about it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the final place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 at the Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad P@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once more in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings 6 times and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish strongly this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle &apos;s Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung his sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inning at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play again .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton terminated the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks hit a Bun@@ t , and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier a Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape to the right @-@ handed rac@@ ist Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end Run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play .
when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , Wall made an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit was the pro@@ pr@@ elu@@ de of the game from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ner in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right side , but managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three ranks with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ off .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since the 20th August because of a perfor@@ ation in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be found in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who are anger@@ ed in it will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening .
it counted between 450 and 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , there have been 7@@ 500 people in Hessen , according to the president of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is facing our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures did not call it and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria about the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees in a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ shot and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opinion has been unanim@@ ously divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now master a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkans .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to seal the border with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent the smu@@ g@@ gling over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ at said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , ye@@ witnesses report thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the Pi@@ p@@ anz@@ er des Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ ans .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon sw@@ aps easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
this movement is only small , but nevertheless too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientific paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already long known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Saturn ore in 2006 , which sp@@ ies water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Val@@ det R@@ ama about one month .
an investigation led to an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association informed .
R@@ ama was compla@@ ining about pain earlier this week .
according to Munich , the diagnosis &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ edi@@ tary loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to its lean line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nonetheless : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. They mainly contain man@@ gos but plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the color of the peel only says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ é and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first F@@ öh@@ n@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn wind breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on Thursday night , the hair @-@ dryer sometimes blows with storm @-@ strength through the spru@@ ces @-@ valleys .
after fle@@ eing on Thursday morning a distinctive cold front will cross us , which brings vigor@@ ous rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure basin over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the side of the Alps , on Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the hair @-@ dryer blows up until Thursday morning in the F@@ öh@@ n@@ tal valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent center of Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ bs of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the hill@@ side slopes .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , which has already been large rainf@@ all over the past few days .
on Thursday morning the air dri@@ es out , as a result a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures are falling significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Place in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino on Wednesday a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , recalled on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es , for centuries as a minority , were often only able to live their faith in secret .
the square became visible in a symbolic fashion , that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a broken sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to historians his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the spl@@ itting of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated scrip@@ ture texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with glorious pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 reasons formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that address topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
in doing so , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological focus as well as for the Kettler Press , with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into today , into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out this , in order to perhaps even tolerate me with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art to greater importance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today , the perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ planted .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not considered the Bible to be fully compreh@@ ended , but the most important , also mysterious subjects selected for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it concerns the images , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak to M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X trains
plans made , place found , companies mand@@ ated to model earth hills for a round course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
failures in politics and administration were responsible for casting , especially among the residents who did not want to endure the path .
so hill deported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will take place in October , the First Local General , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , was now able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year &apos;s still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be commen@@ ced without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga will mark a clear mark on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is responding to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy his help in cop@@ ing with the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been keeping this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s not going to happen to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role to play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ Di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will support the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s head of sports Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvi@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football con@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our beam force , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large joint work in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their locations was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called out the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board of directors loses an eye on accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s biggest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , he was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was involved in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can pass something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to rise up once you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

judgment : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus versus K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be absent from the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high burden on his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his pedi@@ gre@@ es on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change on the door@@ bell position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the master mas@@ on Roman citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether wil@@ der skins will be used in all Europa League Games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also play the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fellow players R@@ eus said that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B must be the goal in the Europa League , keeps middle @-@ field players Julian Wei@@ gl as understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart in the G@@ 7 countries , which will also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid rise on digital radio .
there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly assumes the leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads can be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany by 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Euro MP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must however be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans still look scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the inspection organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent expect it to be 31 percent in all .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in a traffic jam of 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current status in the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf fair@@ ground will only open in singles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision must be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , member of the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to thank you for a great read .
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which thanks to video projections look reck@@ less human .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially le@@ aning attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed overall artistic work for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to freeze dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry - Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot moved to Munich with 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather h@@ osen outfit with a cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier said in Munich .
later on I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as fashion niche
in the past , the long lines of embroi@@ dery in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make metres .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in great quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working alone today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Company .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , and was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt gives some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use any ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
we have already completed half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , Mo@@ dra P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
private specialized stores and wholesale distribution are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , export is weak@@ ening , currently facing Russia and the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association tries to score with environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery mil@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have been running a quality seal which shows that we produce environmentally friendly and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the University of Applied Arts Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
that takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was revi@@ ving the historical snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine sticks small spheres in some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße had inspired him : &quot; before I could do nothing with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who want to remember a piece of memory .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney vent@@ ured into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a new movie but a continuation of 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should engage in attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Board for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ ling the local mel@@ tdown system .
after the statement , a negative list is drawn up , identified sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is important because it points to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and is open to the market , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen inspections on powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimi@@ zing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lawyers &apos; right to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to expect a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; are to be lifted from one ogram of fish per kil@@ ogram of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be dispro@@ portion@@ ate .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU , according to Food@@ watch , wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 mg mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Food@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already observe the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious de@@ fle@@ ction maneu@@ ver that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolfgang Wolf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish via the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts of particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the maximum values in force that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is above all caused by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet over six tons of mercury per year according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , two @-@ thirds of the total volume issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for instance in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most common health risks reported in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
