if the association , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereign power , however , extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , the organization reimbur@@ ses these costs as long as it has been clari@@ fied in advance .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be entitled to the Organization and its officials for the purposes of implementing this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states .
any claim that the community or state against the organization or the organization with respect to the organization or the organisation towards the community or a state for damages , with the exception of damages resulting from a nuclear incident , arising out of the implementation of the securing measures according to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted to him by the Director General , that the organization has not been able to check out for nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ ks under this Convention , he can reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and possibly take the other measures provided there .
in such a case , the Council takes into account the measures in which measures have been obtained by the applied safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to provide the advice necessary for the Council .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations on questions arise which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the State concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions through the Council .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on security measures as required .
the aim of the procedures for securing measures defined in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive bodies for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ r@@ ence of such an exit due to the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations carried out by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone , the material quantity which is not weigh@@ ted for a particular period under specification of the accuracy limits for the indicated seas is specified .
in carrying out their investigations , the Organization shall make full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
in the application of its backup measures , the Community will use de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee , as required in the supplementary agreements , and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measuring system for as@@ cer@@ taining the amounts of preserved , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory ;
( B ) the assessment of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipients ;
e ) Proced@@ ures for the assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which detects the core material inventory and the changes of the stock for each material balance zone including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) Ur@@ an or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) , will divide the amount and composition of the material if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to hed@@ ging in accordance with this Convention , is not possible or desired , thus consult the organization and the community on the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this material material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the Community the organization releases the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention :
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) nuclear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such material is re@@ usable , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is more than 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures according to this Convention , from these security measures , if the whole amount of nuclear material released in the States is no longer required at any time than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ liable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated nuclear material together with nuclear material , which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , is to be processed or stored , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization complementary agreements , which are required in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention , in the individual to apply the procedures set forth in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization is based on the initial report compiled in Article 62 of the total , the backup measures of this convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory list as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their review .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the E@@ WG has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ential problems .
C ) The objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Activities &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account , and ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as the &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which are payable on request in the currency of the state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the relevant country .
( B ) The payment is made in two rates ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Each Member State may make payments in front of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school j@@ ures to cover the expenses for the special loan loan and compensate the special transaction in an appropriate manner .
when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special loan loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and quickly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices which are considered , approved and administr@@ ated for the funding granted by the Organization ( under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special account may not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 special transaction loans are subject to the same deposit conditions , which apply to the loan granted by the organization ; they are thus re@@ payable in ten years each in 50 years .
special loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this clock are to be made directly to the organization that maintains it .
each special loan loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient land and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or rendered ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the benef@@ ici@@ ary of a special loan granted by the administrator at the time of the loan granted .
cash withdraw@@ als from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , the ste@@ ward informs the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the examination of the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the payment of the special loan loan , the administrator instruc@@ ts the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special loan loan and the expendi@@ tures made for it .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization at this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC shall forward as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are deduc@@ ed from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the EEC and the administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time exchange an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account , the progress of programmes or projects financed through special action figures and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may agree with , the agreement and all obligations resulting from it shall be due immediately .
if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is ref@@ unded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from it shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedure .
the Sec@@ retariat also conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of the entry of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is written in two in@@ scriptions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wording is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T follows the following procedure :

with every stand@@ by credit the BI@@ S would first take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without having to exceed a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first scre@@ enings shall not be made prior to exp@@ iry of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the withdraw@@ als would take place in the currencies available to the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time considering the funds of the bank , expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those that the BI@@ S applies at the moment under similar conditions , that is , the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to provide the necessary means on the market itself , then the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor that corresponds to a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close the stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to give me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community is making arrangements so that the sale of inter@@ ven@@ tional stands on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation on the sale of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of ref@@ unds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs , shall only be subject to prices and conditions which are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .

the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not named collective bar@@ gaining numbers after the Community .
the Committee discusses all issues that arise during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties in the context of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 January .
the amount used by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied to the foundation of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich des Uruguay over trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I encourage myself to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on imports of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff zone 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff zone 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the common tari@@ ff tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined according to the Community by the following annual amount :
in order to ensure a flaw@@ less operation of the agreement , Uruguay , by means of appropriate procedures , guarantees that the actual amount of the annual volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in the technology and in trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee under No. 10 , in order to find a reasonable solution .
in the event that the community is entitled to the clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the Community market regulated by this agreement will not be affected .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community under@@ takes to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement to a maximum rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community will change the amount specified under number 2 in consultation with Uruguay , according to the volume of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State .
the import duty for these new Member States will be determined in accordance with the rules of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ stein set of the exhaus@@ tion is taken into account under number 5 .
the total quantity referred to below number 2 is set to 5 800 tonnes of slaughter with the day of the accession of Greece to the community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community is making arrangements so that the sale of intervention stands on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an conductor .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of ref@@ unds or other funding measures for the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lambs , shall only be subject to prices and conditions which are in line with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Or@@ al and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences for the products specified in this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
the Community is oblig@@ ated to make all necessary arrangements so that the separation of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay depends on the submission of an export licence , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing regulations , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informs the quantities that have been issued for export lic@@ ences ; these data may be en@@ rolled according to the destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied to the foundation of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic Ö@@ st@@ lich des Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ue to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) hem@@ atic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured with repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely for the volume of the blood @-@ body floo@@ ding in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as the complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floo@@ ding .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ le of the Un@@ known Re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ ative or a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form per label is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the feasibility studies ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ous pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as long as the re@@ agent with the added substance remains the pre@@ conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ essively or re@@ dissolved serum .

the re@@ agents required for the international exchange of blood groups should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued are stored for such a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the Char@@ ge is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
