<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">The organization is based on the initial report compiled in Article 62 of the total, the backup measures of this convention in the states, regardless of its origin, and continues this inventory list as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their review.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general ressourcentransferential problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the funds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Activities" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account, and (in this capacity the organization is referred to as the "administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which are payable on request in the currency of the state in order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the relevant country.</seg>
<seg id="737">(B) The payment is made in two rates (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments in front of the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school jures to cover the expenses for the special loan loan and compensate the special transaction in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting this loan, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special loan loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and quickly payable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices which are considered, approved and administrated for the funding granted by the Organization (under the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special account may not be used instead of the Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which has been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4 special transaction loans are subject to the same deposit conditions, which apply to the loan granted by the organization; they are thus repayable in ten years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this clock are to be made directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special loan loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient land and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or rendered (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the beneficiary of a special loan granted by the administrator at the time of the loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Cash withdrawals from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is to be rejected as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full awarding of all special transaction loans, the steward informs the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the examination of the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the payment of the special loan loan, the administrator instructs the EEC quarterly on the development of the special loan loan and the expenditures made for it.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organisation a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization at this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC shall forward as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are deduced from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrator work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator to the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time exchange an exchange of ideas about the state of the special action account, the progress of programmes or projects financed through special action figures and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may agree with, the agreement and all obligations resulting from it shall be due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is refunded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations resulting from it shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States notifies the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to terminate the procedure.</seg>
