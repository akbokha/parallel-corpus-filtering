this document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you need further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ res thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental disorder where patients have experienced episodes of abnormal mood alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing of tablets .
in patients taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted to A@@ bili@@ fy .
this affects signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were subjected to increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with half @-@ operated , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which were subjected to increased rest@@ lessness , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into account .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the re@@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disorders ( un@@ controlled disease ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes approached the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no higher suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ aller@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ates , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be combined with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
due to the insufficient data situation for human health and the concerns that arise in the animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative effect on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with semi @-@ operated ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with om@@ lan@@ t@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under cervi@@ cal treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the adverse events that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths .
there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma retention .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ stream .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operated @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who were attending the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operating dol 73 % ) in week 52 .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sets scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than half @-@ operation .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operated in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or semi @-@ operated .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partially did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ian patients who reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed against placebo considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for hydro@@ xy@@ modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive met@@ aboli@@ sm over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
one single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent survival toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ments @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dosage ( based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l did not exceed 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the prevention of recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should continue with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be combined with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ lic met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in the bile after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ th of the recommended maximum dosage ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the medium ste@@ ady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ oxi@@ fication and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended to the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under circum@@ vention of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tab@@ let@@ tes or A@@ bili@@ fy Solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ oral disorders , which were other than caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ aller@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , alternating states of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular heart@@ beat or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ ates , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in the case of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ sm the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
cavi@@ ties of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence also in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operating dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ oral disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of det@@ achment and behavi@@ oral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed average improvement from the initial value to the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness , a similar effectiveness has been observed with regard to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operated @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who were attending the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operating dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement than half @-@ operation .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the incidence rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ din controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which in part over 2 weeks did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in man@@ ian patients who reached re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed against placebo considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent survival toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ments @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans ( based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the medium steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low or low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited Company for the transport of abra@@ x@@ anes throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment can be interrupted until a recovery is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ular formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological features than other pac@@ lit@@ axel form@@ ulations ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients no recur@@ r@@ ence treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ anes .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ cking means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of mothers with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with abra@@ x@@ anes will be advised to witness during and up to six months after the treatment no child .
male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm preservation , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the efficiency and ability to serve machines .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most remarkable hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with abra@@ x@@ anes and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects listed in connection with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , tender g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , muscle pain , muscle pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ i@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the amalg@@ amation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules through in@@ hibition of their land@@ oly@@ mer .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in communic@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ mare receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ arm in@@ verb@@ ed trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abra@@ x@@ anes , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during the treatment .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy as a result of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposition ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine removal was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ancer drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances , caution should be taken care of when handling abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile injection , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ per@@ fusion bottle .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference doctor &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels which may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin deficiency .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this trial had been inj@@ ected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either converted to stre@@ amed stre@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main indicator for efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sudden mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , is providing information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5,@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
an@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.3 g / dl or &lt; 4.3 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; hence the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary to control the treatment symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular number around ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ ular number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l three times a week , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular number around &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood accounts is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( Day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg to 10 consecutive days each , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ le needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who develop an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ony ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an ab@@ rupt or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients who are intended for a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pro@@ s , es@@ cor@@ on@@ ary or under@@ under@@ disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the recur@@ r@@ ence value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum allergies , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the antibody index ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have not shown significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ xy , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the influ@@ x symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ offering and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapies @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are intended for a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy and be treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in cases of underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces can not be ruled out in case of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial mo@@ b value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , Epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stri@@ ved
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose is adapted to the increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral stroke , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , retinal thro@@ mb@@ oses , retin@@ alis thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or wor@@ sen@@ ing an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin isolated from the urine in local patients .
it could be shown by means of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated with an@@ a@@ emia a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in control .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no grief : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of approval for the market has to supply the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is set up and functional before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the traffic .
the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance , as outlined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , is required to carry out the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal products for human use , an updated R@@ MP should simultaneously be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information , the impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , or the risk reduction measures , • In 60 days after reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ gi@@ ance or risk reduction ) Mil@@ estones
• In a month before your treatment have suffered a heart attack or stroke , if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • the risk of a hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if you have previously performed such a blood drop earlier
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ) have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood levels , which re@@ forms with further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before starting therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ eria , it will inter@@ rupt your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to this knowledge , the treatment of the blood poverty with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ offering and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your final dose accordingly in order to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past , thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances may have a negative impact on the tumor .
if there is a major orthop@@ edic operation , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins .
if your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge formation after surgery .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines / apply or have been taken recently / used even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedy for the suppression of the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of intervention and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure Ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ e@@ dem@@ a ) and shock@@ ing allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ac@@ ia means that no more red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special care when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge formation ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can go along with an increased risk of blood sample formation after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) if your initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the fridge and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded .
Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a lower traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture as in patients ; • Mor@@ van Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ected into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ 0,000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2,@@ 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients with placebo .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ up@@ a provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine be explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of orders in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include : • Con@@ contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg is once a year recommended .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cancer @-@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents of Ac@@ up@@ a are not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data are missing for safety and efficacy .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with Ac@@ last@@ a by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be weigh@@ ed before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available for patients who need dental intervention , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 @-@ 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) in patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure , as well as a limited ren@@ al function , were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the acet@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a versus 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently sl@@ ated hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ es .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in one patient treated with a placebo and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone @-@ bone frac@@ ture or BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for string neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased the bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.3 % , the neck @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vis after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the trab@@ ecular bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ last@@ a significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ last@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
Ac@@ last@@ a treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total hardness and 4.3 % on the stem cell .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate severe mor@@ bus paste of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 x 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of cit@@ ric acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study of the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic approach was maintained in 141 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plas@@ m@@ acid level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value t ½ α = 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eli@@ oration period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values above ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearing is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron @-@ acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function down to a cre@@ atine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid required .
because there are only limited data available for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are available for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest in@@ let @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats were 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
in studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C have the 6@@ fold the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ fold human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
the most common findings in studies with repeated use were an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a finding which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Pa@@ get , the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines , tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or have been recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drink , you should be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you can take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to do the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the operative supply of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ last@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment is finished with Ac@@ last@@ a Falls you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please note your next doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent after the following in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
at present it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pains and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw@@ s were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , Ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , the patients must be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
in patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ ine vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a .

it additionally contributes to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to the absence of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported by up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases exceeds the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Pro@@ evaluation Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) that cannot be adjusted satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ ate resin or insulin , the current dosage of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ li@@ um or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ ate resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ stick , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ stick was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who additionally took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , reported a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the placing of orders in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enzyme values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms related to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ weight problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by the clinical assessment by the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases it is associated with a fluid retention .
a minor reduction of mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) was reduced as a result of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes have been observed in comparable controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients under sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ li@@ um and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ stick or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity was reported .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of un@@ desirable events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or that occurs , the treatment is stopped ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ asc@@ ents over the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range also often appeared as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ material .

a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it has been shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a significant statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas values decreased in met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de .
in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the low tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ den@@ o@@ dic@@ ally increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both by an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups that received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radio@@ actively marked Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the waste ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ ine and elevated insulin resistance of the uter@@ us decreases and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder were induced .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes over the risks out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in respect to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA over insulin origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required during the change to Ac@@ tim@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .

the push button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check a pres@@ et dose • Do the number on the cap directly next to the dosage brand • Do the highest number you can see on the pressure level • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
otherwise insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the set dose will not be correct • If you have acci@@ dentally tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow the steps below :
then remove the cap and set it up again that the 0 of the dispens@@ ing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the push button pressed until the injection needle was pulled out of the skin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ cur@@ p@@ id may have to be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin @-@ acting insulin must first be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of insulin which is long acting .
3 If a dose adjustment is required for the patient , this can be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that a mort@@ ality induced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ cur@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mort@@ ality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : if you inj@@ ected too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you do more than otherwise physically
keep the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready pens whenever it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Des@@ cri@@ be the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ up@@ fer • Do you always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the injection needle from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • tigh@@ ten the injection needle directly and tightly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • tigh@@ ten the large external cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and to ensure proper dosage : • Ke@@ ep up Ac@@ cur@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle after a few times with the finger slightly against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , these are collected in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to keep the injection needle up , rotate the cartridge by one click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows upwards , press the push button ( Figure C ) • Now from the tip of the injection needle you must leave a drop of insulin .
• Res@@ et the cap again so on the finished pen that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Figure D ) • Check if the push button is completely pushed down .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button ( pus@@ h@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Follow the highest number you can see on the pressure dial • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap simply for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance , then remove the cap and set it up again that the 0 of the dispens@@ ing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only while the injection is pressed • Ke@@ ep the push button pressed until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
you may not specify a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual scale scale to estimate how much insulin is left but you can &apos;t use it to adjust or select your dose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or po@@ ison@@ ous nodes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mal @-@ crystalline deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still a number of adverse events ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take other medicines for the prevention of sei@@ zur@@ es at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , where 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year to 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to that , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and the blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one of the currently known or currently available g@@ out nodes and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ n@@ ar acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into account .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
transplan@@ t Rec@@ ei@@ vers Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other drug @-@ like medicines , a acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment beginning , because the reduction of the serum har@@ n@@ acid saw must first mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B . in case of malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that there is a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing clinical studies of phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll in Z@@ eous did not have any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ ic mirror ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily measured an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be ruled out on the side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect det@@ ri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or when carrying out dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall study group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an ather@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups a total of more than once , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin ras@@ hes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 trials ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

the reduction of the serum har@@ n@@ age acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum carcin@@ oma &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( D ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum har@@ n@@ ar acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ ar acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum har@@ n@@ ar concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open renewal study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum har@@ n@@ ar acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a g@@ out surge ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ out node size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ ums by month 24 .
elevated TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ east@@ at after administration were easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum har@@ n@@ ar concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) by F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cer ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as acid re@@ aring .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against algae dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied .
it may not be applied in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission informed Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or cr@@ ush the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point out possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be noted in the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ bul@@ ding heart@@ burn or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an ab@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
although no increased risk was detected in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapist contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a s@@ late @-@ surgical procedure will reduce the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
they should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may interfere with the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opor@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , absorption of serum calcium was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ vert an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract like stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ hydr@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ ktur Inter@@ ven@@ tional Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D from the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to hold ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and subsequently 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Up to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast and two hours before commen@@ cement of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats yiel@@ ded that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
secre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ algae , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot .
according to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the waste after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted from the urine .
although there are no clinical data about it , however , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ hydr@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ hydr@@ ate in the bone is expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , head@@ ache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicine should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f since the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level characteristics ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both levels of kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ents are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral taking of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
additional dosage adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ sation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be changed a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to once daily intake of ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplantation should begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are switched to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , p@@ ank@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the target range , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the Ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ ometer of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum incre@@ ment level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine capacity and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f In the transition from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advised caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ low levels .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood sugar levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the levels of blood are not exceeded in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the seb@@ ac@@ eous levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
this has resulted in serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult cardiac transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscle concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases an aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes .
if patients who occupy Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , lac@@ tose include , special caution is required in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood mirrors with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dop@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in the comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often difficult to determine because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are often increased the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ m@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction paths in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain line of lymph@@ oma genes .

175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atitis and in 6@@ 30 cases after a col@@ on transplantation were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported in more than 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was seen less frequently in the first year following the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ar and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans was compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients killed by Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t A multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplantation which received a random@@ ized trial of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
col@@ on transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplantation showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ al transplantation ) under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us leading to Tal@@ ents between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recent transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 4@@ 04 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this can be noted that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via g@@ all .
in stable patients treated with Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once a day ) on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( once a day ) in the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG company in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity is not to fall under the specified plas@@ m@@ ural level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients less than 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during treatment it is recommended to control the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II plasma label .
individual patients can differ in response to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II directed by Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post @-@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II mirror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated that were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes has been reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ actor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required , that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company reg@@ ains its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of female Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected by it .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene which is not defective in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ er@@ ous cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the abdom@@ en of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will generate a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it has not been adequately proven that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will bring benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not prove sufficient evidence that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way , and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is slowly released for a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ apped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients took their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( hel@@ pl@@ essness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular disease , including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral stroke ) , or risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Company to introduce aer@@ op@@ lanes in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking it , to break or ch@@ ew ) .
due to the absence of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such treatment .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to give appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be cancelled in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not in@@ hibited in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the persist@@ ence of the use of aer@@ os@@ ol during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic safety or ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ al processes .

a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of adhesion molecules P sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ der , including the reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily did not detect increased incidence of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause other symp@@ a@@ thetic effects such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) by pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposition after administration of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety margin , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ology studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tears or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , som@@ nia with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver flu@@ kes , has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hili@@ z@@ ate to take ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for taking .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
for children between 6 and 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by identifying symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ ling , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom point ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline in symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted to the SP Europe Company a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the current illness course and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms and are res@@ um@@ ed .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic safety or ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo reported fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were given .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of adhesion molecules P sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over ten days in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was given over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ der , including the reinforcement of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the different forms of path@@ ophysi@@ ology , and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that , besides the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , dis@@ infection leads to an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ cs in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka were excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient demo@@ s were comparable with the general seas@@ on@@ ally allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant grief after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded altogether .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could not recognize any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by infection in children under 2 years of age ( see section 4.4 ) and there are no data available to support the treatment of a infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis .
around 6 % of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are subject to dimin@@ ishing and experienced a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age that can be limited is identical to that of children that are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more adverse events reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were given .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years old ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children is similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psych@@ omot@@ ors .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are restricted .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance @-@ grief after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable in pedi@@ atric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt pill must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ z@@ ate to take @-@ in formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly @-@ metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ z@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg doses in children from 6 to 11 years .

A@@ eri@@ us solution for inclusion is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , elderly people included .
if the solution involves applying a application sy@@ ringe for preparations with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for taking it .
regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s under which you are suffering and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years diarr@@ ho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia were frequent side effects while in adults fatigue , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness and head@@ ache were often reported as placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for insertion is available in bottles with a child safe cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml package size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for inhal@@ ation with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain arises from the flu virus , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus was removed with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the assessment of the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you need further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to take @-@ in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination is not investigated .
aspir@@ ation should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral drug the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines are taken .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aspir@@ in depends on the body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ a reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug used with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared with placebo , but A@@ gener@@ a was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ a also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ a reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ a combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amalg@@ am or any of the other ingredients .
aspir@@ ation may also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are also degra@@ ded in the same way as A@@ gener@@ a and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who occupy A@@ gener@@ a are taking the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years versus the risks .
A@@ gener@@ a is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefit of aspir@@ in in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited for the placing of A@@ gener@@ a in the entire European Union .
aspir@@ in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of aspir@@ in in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ a is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver dysfunction , and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations which contain St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal consequences .
for the event of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver failure under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ co@@ ster@@ oids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the an@@ nex function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of aspir@@ in with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active ingredients .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ a can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amalg@@ am , patients should therefore be monitored on om@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially when low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ y content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
aspir@@ ation should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ foli@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
for H@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient is already taking St. John &apos;s wort , the pren@@ atal mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , on the other hand , 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the fantasy component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ a are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
this is why in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when these drugs are used together , be careful ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , thereby increasing the side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with aspir@@ in , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ a in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ stress ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions in common with A@@ gener@@ a .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as aspir@@ in , since it can cause res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
con@@ current intake with A@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of study subjects , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive elev@@ ations of the plasma can be expected with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a .
because plasma levels increase this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ e@@ oly@@ r .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ a may not be used together with an or@@ ally @-@ recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while careful use of A@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in plasma levels from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on om@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , especially when low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , such as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
during the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
amalg@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the introduction to the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breast feeding .
the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moder@@ ately pronounced , rose early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
many of these events have not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive pre@@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with study media and were performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and potential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of breasts and dor@@ sal li@@ pos@@ al li@@ pos@@ u@@ ction .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated subjects treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients underwent 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes were usually slightly up to moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canc@@ eled with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with a severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , species and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received a@@ generations together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting action .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ levels with the consequence of an formation of non @-@ infectious , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with Chr@@ onic infected cells .
the link between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ e@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically investigated .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of specific mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance test@@ ings can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between amalg@@ am and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 types of fossi@@ ls , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at treatment start and another against ti@@ dal cavi@@ ar ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
inver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which A@@ gener@@ a ( 600 mg twice daily ) together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ sub@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub @-@ threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking and capsules was examined three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ a .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ booked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ in should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) amounts to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increases , by contrast , by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady @-@ state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ atal remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspir@@ in ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily amalg@@ am exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a solution of 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ a capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ atal plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved on healthy volunteers at a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were present in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there were little hints for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of aspir@@ in nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in case of systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
aspir@@ ation should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , on the other hand , 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
when these drugs are used together , be careful ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with aspir@@ in , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available for this .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of study subjects , the fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol declined by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ a , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during the pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the in@@ fusion in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during breast feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting action .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % in@@ hibition concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M with chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
inver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ paid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ in should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ atal remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspir@@ in ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were present in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there are little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism paths are not yet fully mature so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ aching &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution for en@@ roll@@ ment has neither been verified with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution for taking up ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patient groups is avoided .
although dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content , A@@ gener@@ a is contra@@ indicated for taking in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ a does not prevent risk 47 of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
aspir@@ ation should be set in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
for H@@ amm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increases , on the other hand , 30 % lower for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ current intake with A@@ gener@@ a can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . apart from possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l should not be applied during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
amalg@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given by the in@@ fusion in the uter@@ us until the end of the breast@@ feeding time , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during breast feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ a was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ a or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such mut@@ ations described in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were rarely observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
early abor@@ tion of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ paid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ in should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large ve@@ al volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

perhaps you would like to read this later again . − If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − If any of the listed side effects you are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to use A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effect of aspir@@ in .
the use of A@@ gener@@ a is based on the individual viral resistance test performed by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above diseases or taking any of the above medicine .
if your doctor has advised that you are taking A@@ gener@@ a capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure you have carefully read the usage information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prior to the treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the efficiency of children between 4 and 12 years or generally in patients less than 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ a with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before starting A@@ gener@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control the bleeding . − In patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .
if you have certain drugs that may lead to serious side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , lip@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as aspir@@ in , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize potential security problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
efficiency and operation of machinery There were no studies on the influence of ag@@ ro@@ gens on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
taking Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after aspir@@ in , otherwise the effects of as@@ gener@@ a can be reduced .
dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ e@@ r twice daily ) .
85 So it is very important that you take the whole daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
if you have taken a larger amount of A@@ gener@@ a than you should if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ a , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ gener@@ a If you have forgotten taking A@@ gener@@ a , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking it as before .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream must be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , four weeks &quot; break between the treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected skin areas so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and al@@ dar@@ a or placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adult if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatments are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .

the treatment with i@@ be@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible fung@@ i in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the procedure described above should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ be@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to be applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed in the cleaned skin area infected with cow@@ or@@ king until the cream is completely covered .
in these patients it should take place between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients it should be weigh@@ ed between the benefits of an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily prim@@ acy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with one for circumc@@ ision are observed .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the end of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience is available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external fung@@ i in the genital and peri@@ anal area .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of risk reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the inclined war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are formed after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since no data is available for long term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is available in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs . therefore , the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ od@@ ine @-@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
only very limited data is available about the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute Ker@@ at@@ osen in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for several days .
data from an open clinical study suggest that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) are not achieved after a unique topical application ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast feeding .
the most frequently shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most frequently reported and reported as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the effects reported by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , prob@@ able or possibly associated side effect with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects , which were given from 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream , are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een by the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it frequently came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , erosion ( 23 % ) , and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een by the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and cal@@ isation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of the ac@@ tin @-@ ker@@ at@@ ose , Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ent one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were fully healed ; this was in the case of 20 % of the 105 with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ colour treatments per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic Ak@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face .
the six @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment rooms .
the approved indications external F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , acute ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ency bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , Plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimum systemic absorption of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on the systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for four months for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice when administered three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a slight systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be considered very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that were treated with the active cream , earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you are significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of the gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and anus ( after ) ● superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently occurring , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if it remains untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore an early detection and - treatment is important .
acute Ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in humans who were exposed to exposure to sunlight during their life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in case of flat acute cases in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ es , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the mo@@ tions complic@@ ate , reduced pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
for children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year all new information that may be known , check and update this summary whenever necessary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in response to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to move Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ socket I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , to increase all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting , in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as there is little experience in res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an inter@@ ruption of the treatment , precau@@ tions must be taken care of .
to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tic ) .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment should be weigh@@ ed with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduce the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ca and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ enz with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase above breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe li@@ ve@@ form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it occurred in patients at the age of 5 years with a heavier wa@@ ve@@ form ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to early retirement from the study ) , no antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were det@@ ectable in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it never came to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with ab@@ rupt or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the average phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute ear test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of the lung function and the capacity shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of the children .
from the 26 patients with an H@@ ep@@ ath@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zes clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy @-@ variable ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe sl@@ ump form and 4 with an average circulation form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 .
in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe circul@@ atory form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average circulation form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe circul@@ atory form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development was to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute @-@ test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .
if ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be kept , provided the di@@ lution occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the specified period , the holder of approval for the placing of the market has completed the following study programme , whose results are the basis for the annual review report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in a small quantity or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , including prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors or medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient tolerate this , gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nausea • skin rash • joints disorders , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • red@@ dening • Hyper@@ tension • Hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer of cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( malign@@ ant &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who haven &apos;t been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells , resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural relief , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the treatment of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival compared to the same medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to move A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with previously advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given .
during the seven days before the first dose p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third movement cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a full blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient value before the treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ tive nucle@@ i a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no clu@@ e that in patients with age 65 years or above , compared to patients at age 65 years , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose calculations were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose @-@ adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values ( in liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ital immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils drop a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ologic toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was considered when a preliminary treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 was taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current consumption of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a therapy is provided with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients , in which these events occurred , had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion can be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible fo@@ stering of reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the treatment bed to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ lo@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the immune status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as in the case of an@@ red@@ - or an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be applied during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the closure of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of un@@ desirable effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and who were random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the combined results of three individual P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) , except Neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these under@@ - far@@ ew@@ ells are likely to lead to differences in the patient population since the pha@@ sis 2 studies have included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ sensitive metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a slow@@ ing down of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy treated patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival occurred in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non@@ pl@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel is similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with the gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant substrates according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the total population a Statisti@@ cal value for non @-@ under@@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ sub@@ section of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients needed the administration of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mon@@ o@@ therapeutic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - ones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is largely eliminated in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in urine within 24 hours of use .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total capacity of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring extends from color@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the sample .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
patients taking All@@ i and taking no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats inf@@ ested with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with fa@@ eces , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , bile duct ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not sufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and pregnant women .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) weight reduction and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or , fet@@ al @-@ induced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • A lac@@ tation period ( see Section 4.6 ) • St@@ unning time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or obes@@ e diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ant contrac@@ tions in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international standard ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time dose , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects observed after the Or@@ list@@ at market launch is unknown because these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and over@@ weight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on human and animal studies it can be assumed that any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active serum @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ sions .
clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or , fet@@ al @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameter , the change of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , in the case of therapeutic doses , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of an accumulation .
two major met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans .
pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in July 2007 as in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used with over@@ weight adults from 18 years onwards with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight compared to your height or are over@@ weight .
even if these conditions do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should ask your doctor for a control examination .
with the help of all@@ i , you can lose an additional kilogram for 2 kg of body weight that you lose in the frame of a diet .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other drugs or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ tations , in severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral in@@ increasing means of pregnancy prevention ( pill ) may be weakened or revers@@ ed if you have strong diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) .
before taking all@@ i , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you take medicines for high blood pressure since possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted . • If you take medicines for too high cholesterol , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
for more information on how to set your cal@@ ori@@ sts and fet@@ al limits , see Other helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 .
if you have a meal or a meal contains no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fet@@ al du@@ et diet .
di@@ ets are effective as you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutrition is fet@@ ched to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • St@@ ay during intake and also after completion of taking all@@ i physically active .
• all@@ i should not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you are unable to determine any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of use by all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
under certain circumstances , you have to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing your diet at short notice and then return to the old habits again .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take a capsule .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts , because at this time you may have not yet reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ inner a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ charged diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take for each meal , not to take it in form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with those accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store medicine for children . • Do not use any exp@@ ir@@ ation date stated on the box . • Do not store over 25 ° C . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ agel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low this in any case . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is included in this package .

being over@@ weight has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer • oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to feed permanently healthy .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules that you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
follow the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week of weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means you daily work little or no way up stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal per day daily , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30 @-@ 45 minutes of gardening or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and also adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional diary with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat tones and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information helps you to develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ oh@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , the strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , and chemotherapy , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
in three major studies , Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the firm of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ itted chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ itted chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid given before chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not in@@ hibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs tested against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ation is not possible , so pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. approved pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to the intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that the overall composition achieved once daily intake of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the is@@ ob@@ ics C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body weight was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver function disorders , the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies effects were observed only by ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggest@@ ing that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block I@@ onic channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose accounted for about 30@@ times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses of dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for unique application , the relevance of these results is very low .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced , which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study in patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of reference drug treatment to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study showed how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was ret@@ ar@@ ded by more patients than the reference drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the study used in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infection may not work .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients at the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the skin area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was stopped after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with placebo said treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were considered together with Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . , a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should also be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered when no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin area is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retin@@ ot@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should be continued / ended or the therapy should be continued / ended with Al@@ tar@@ go , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go applied , the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation was at the place of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ap@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ap@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial reef which distinguishes itself from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer centre .
by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partially P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should a consultation by experts should be considered due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the application of retin@@ ulin at at least some types of infection .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ot@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ pped skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid alterations .

there was neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was reached than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ il@@ ted skin :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged 1 to 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing in two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a small risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be carried out .
if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same constitu@@ ents as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix &apos;s children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix are also used as proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix applied for a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between inj@@ ections was similar .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine cans ) are head@@ ache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the arrival of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire country .
the standardization plan for pri@@ ori@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if you wish to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who responded to a hepatitis C vacc@@ ination need a concep@@ tu@@ alization as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the administration of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may be achieved after pri@@ mer synthesis , so that in these cases the administration of additional vacc@@ ines can be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal in@@ oc@@ clu@@ sion , these injection channels should be avoided .
in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous because in these cases it can lead to bleeding after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mas@@ on m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ro@@ cking vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines in this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of ambient environment was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ urities on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to the overall vacc@@ ination cycle ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination pattern .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine with 360 @-@ ELISA @-@ units formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units formally in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ation@@ vaccine with three cans .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ants ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ im@@ p substance .
the immune responses found in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination pattern with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formal in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination pattern .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of de@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination pattern to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination pattern .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the cra@@ fting of a combined Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ an , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and servo conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes , both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .
pursuant to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge approval is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as by bathing in poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not be completely protected from infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B viruses , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus before the two vacc@@ ines ambi@@ valence is / is ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that may damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has already experienced an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of an in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccine against ending the vaccine series .
sometimes ambient conditions for people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots are inj@@ ected under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s def@@ ences / / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you take another medicine ( including those which you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / has or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambi@@ ance , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs .
if ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nevertheless sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ A very common case ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ planted cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ ity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ A case ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Use rate • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 reported cans ) have been reported are :
these include locally limited or extensive ras@@ hes which can be it@@ chy or infl@@ ated , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Read your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child will significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has been known since the first permit for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP argued that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ valence remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has only been put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to small patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is divided into several single doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without an active agent ) .
am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste @-@ massage , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fests form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect which mani@@ fests after the first month of life ) there is an indication of the use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fests deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
because Met@@ aboli@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys occur , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve l@@ esi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery disease , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred during a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental one dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms begin with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during the intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound formed by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set up early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the on@@ set of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative means of nitrogen separation ( sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ yl , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ tic form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral one dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable on the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ded product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no clear effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children not yet able to swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fests deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ tur@@ tles were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before the birth , there were l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery disease , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
psych@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram of recorded sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ates between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral one dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ule form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
when laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast @-@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , impair@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to discharge appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin odor , skin rash , kidney function , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box and the container according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usable until &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose which runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take an accumulated measure of gran@@ ules from the container . • St@@ ay a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Rem@@ ove the recommended amount of gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is given and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain the flow of blood to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a single gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often became a stem ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , an@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except in severe bleeding where it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for le@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ us release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ us release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al failure ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be administered and the ACT once again check 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dose .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tional le@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• Im@@ medi@@ ately hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against deer • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis system and / or ir@@ reversible effects . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally cause bleeding throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters in each case are regularly checked .
the experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tional le@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood flow , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge is@@ ations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and in patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din than in the comparison group at He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organ@@ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , it was possible to indu@@ ce no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose @-@ based and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is documented by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 day and the 1- annual end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for the patients receiving aspir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ ds according to protocol ( prior to angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing cor@@ on@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the division of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .

based on conventional studies of safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or re@@ production ox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks in an exposition up to 10 @-@ fold of the clinical ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied for type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot be processed effectively .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lip@@ o was detected after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the per@@ mis@@ sal of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis Cap@@ acity and reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin need in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced .
any change in the strength of the insulin , the brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delays etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in insulin demand .
3 An inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment schem@@ as .
the substances that increase blood sugar reduction and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be weakened or absent under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ers such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ dine , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ dine and Reser@@ pin .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin enters human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are listed from clinical studies of un@@ desirable drug responses , grouped according to system organ@@ classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration disturbances , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , head@@ ache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous doses of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin the effect of action occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than in the normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male patients between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in the therapeutic dosage range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect of action like normal human insulin and achieves complete glucose @-@ giving effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was found 2 minutes before the meal , a better postoperative control was reached than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 gro@@ oves in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin at administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) prior to the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin in administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - here@@ after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
