<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Proevaluation Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or its treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental disorder where patients have experienced episodes of abnormal mood alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioral disorders, if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adapted to Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works as a "partial agony" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were subjected to increased restlessness over a period of two hours with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with half-operated, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent the recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which were subjected to increased restlessness, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into account.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed significantly greater reduction in symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the reoccurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled disease), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes approached the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of increased restlessness and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for placing Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no higher suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypoalleremia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipates, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be combined with a moderate increase in Aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazol have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for human health and the concerns that arise in the animal reproduction studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol showed a lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with semi-operated (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients with omlantine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 53.3% in patients under cervical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Cavities of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse events that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence also in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and no deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazol has a high plasma retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HTA and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, for alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putstream.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operated-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who were attending the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperating dol 73%) in week 52.</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assets scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than half-operation.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher decline in the incidence rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olandin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective 'weight gain' was, in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior effectiveness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-operated in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or semi-operated.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manian patients who reached remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazol showed against placebo considering the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for hydroxymodelling of Aripiprazol, N-Dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolism over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= poor ') metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in terms of ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent survival toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigments-accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxymetabolites in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the medium steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81th of the recommended maximum dosage (based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulfate-conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol did not exceed 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after doses that led to expositions of the 3- and 11x of the medium steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize the variability, an injection is recommended to the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle under circumvention of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablettes or Abilify Solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripiprazol injection solution in patients with detachment and behavioral disorders, which were other than caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of the bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution is considered necessary, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypoalleremia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, stiffness, alternating states of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular heartbeat or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipates, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to the after sole administration of Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) was used as one-time intramuscularly and who received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In the case of CYP2D6 'bad' (= poor ') Metabolism the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials with oral Aripiprazol (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Cavities of CPK (Kreatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, and their occurrence also in the treatment with Aripiprazol, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioral disorders was the Aripiprazol injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of aggregation / behavioural disturbance compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperating dol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detoxicity and behavioral disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of detachment and behavioral disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed average improvement from the initial value to the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agitightness, a similar effectiveness has been observed with regard to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operated-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who were attending the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperating dol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger improvement than half-operation.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the incidence rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in part over 2 weeks did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study expansion in manian patients who reached remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol showed against placebo considering the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times above the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent survival toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigments-accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxymetabolites in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from the 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans (based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study, 72 (31%) of 229 patients with Abraxane treated patients to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low or low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel containing medicines it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted approval to the Abraxis BioScience Limited Company for the transport of abraxanes throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane treatment, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory neuropathy grade 3, the treatment can be interrupted until a recovery is reached on grade 1 or 2, and at all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticular formulation of paclitaxel that could have significantly other pharmacological features than other paclitaxel formulations (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no recurrence treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with abraxanes.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the administration of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and consticking means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age, which do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of mothers with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraction method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with abraxanes will be advised to witness during and up to six months after the treatment no child.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm preservation, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and dizziness (common) that can affect the efficiency and ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">Below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most remarkable hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with abraxanes and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, the side effects listed in connection with the gift of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, tender gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, muscle pain, muscle pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubules active agent that promotes the amalgamation of the microtubules from the tubular indices and stabilizes the microtubules through inhibition of their landolymer.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin communicates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 nightmare receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-arm inverbed trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with abraxanes, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in form of abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% only had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy as a result of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient exposition (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine removal was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances, caution should be taken care of when handling abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile injection, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane-perfusion bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solids.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete resusboard of the powder is done.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference doctor").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels which may occur in connection with a blood transfusion complications, if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared as injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this trial had been injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they were either converted to streamed streamed or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main indicator for efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period during the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Abseamed were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, sudden migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence has been provided that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the Abseamed, is providing information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co. kg for the transport of abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if bleeding-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">Hemoglobin concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5,9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value rises by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose, which is necessary for the control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6.3 g / dl or &lt; 4.3 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease; hence the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose, which is necessary to control the treatment symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticular number around ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticular number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticular number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl three times a week, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticular number around &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood accounts is required, abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donor program - so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (Day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg to 10 consecutive days each, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistle needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop an erythroblastony (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) with any erythropoietin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an abrupt or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - Erythroblastopenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a major elective orthopedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pros, escoronary or underunderdisease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disorder; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as a reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the recurrence value should be determined and the usual causes of a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum allergies, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulozyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the antibody index), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have not shown significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epoxy, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the influx symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rise should amount approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coronary artery disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin alfa-offering and erythropoietin response should be taken into account (patients who may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapies-related anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of holding the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction in the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are intended for a major elective orthopedic surgery should, if possible, the cause of anaemia before beginning of epoetin alfa therapy and be treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a major elective orthopedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in cases of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular occurrences can not be ruled out in case of epoetin alfa for patients with an initial mob value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, Epoetine has not been proven that patients with symptomatic anaemia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was strived</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the ciclosporin dose is adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>

<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoietin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically-derived epoetin alfa is glycosilized and identical to the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoietin isolated from the urine in local patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown by means of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and the control patient.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin treated with anaemia a consistent, statistically significant higher mortality than in the controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and associated complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and in control.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin, and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin alfa determinations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half-life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no grief: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>

<seg id="544">200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your final dose accordingly in order to minimize the risk of thrombotic event (thrombotic event).</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. if you are obese (adipous) or if in the past, thrombotic vascular occurrences have occurred (e.g. a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are cancer patients, remember that Abseamed like a growth factor for blood cells, and under certain circumstances may have a negative impact on the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If there is a major orthopedic operation, the cause of your anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood-dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not get Abseamed because there is an increased risk of hemorrhage formation after surgery.</seg>

<seg id="550">If you are taking Ciclosporin (remedy for the suppression of the immune system) during your treatment with Abseamed, your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="551">Laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF are means to build up the immune system, for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV).</seg>
<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia refers to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works properly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well set, you will receive regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, distributed on two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia refers to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and ensure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the doctor treating doctor will perform regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of intervention and another 4 days after the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor considers this to be appropriate, you can also learn how to injure Abseamed herself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, brain hemorrhages, stroke, transient circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from erythropoietin treatment.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (bone fractures), including in patients who recently suffered a lower traumatic hip fracture as in patients; • Morvan Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or injected into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a portion of the data material for zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 80,000 elderly women were involved in osteoporosis and the number of vertebral and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies to 357 patients and compared with Risedronate for six months (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">Main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) in the blood normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (excluding other osteoporosis medication) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis medication), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture, 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to citric acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Acupa provides educational material for physicians who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information about how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine be explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following key messages include: • Concontraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg is once a year recommended.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. or intramusculine vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a cancer-inin-clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents of Acupa are not recommended for the use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data are missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be weighed before using bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who need dental intervention, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of severe side effect reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51-3.862) in patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder zoledronic acid has been associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease of the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin-Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure, as well as a limited renal function, were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the acetsta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of the patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of the patients treated with Aclasta in the morbus paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the morbus paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently slated hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of citric acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the maxillofacial area was occasionally reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervenes.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7.736 patients performed osteonecrosis in the jaw area in one patient treated with a placebo and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone-bone fracture or BMD-T-Score for string neck ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, resulting in a reduced risk of hip fractures in one by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on the bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased the bone density on the lumbar spine, hip and distal radius significantly compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine increased by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.3%, the neck-neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 post-menopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvis after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase of the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta significantly reduced by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all time points compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Aclasta treatment performed over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% in total hardness and 4.3% on the stem cell.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebral BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate severe morbus paste of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6 x 3.0x age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of citric acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease of pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 treated patients who participated in the follow-up study of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated with Risedronate, the therapeutic approach was maintained in 141 patients treated with Risedronate during an average follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasmacid level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large cycle with half-value t ½ α = 0.24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elioration period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the t ½ -values above) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearing is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledron's acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledron-acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal function down to a creatine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of zoledronic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only limited data available for severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are available for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest inlet-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats were 0.6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC have the 6fold the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7fold human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred with other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated use were an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphyse of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, a finding which reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and those of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a substance of a substance called bisphosphonate, and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens that are made of androgens, play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget, the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation, giving strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you take other medicines / apply or have been recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Proevaluation Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has reviewed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be adjusted satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonate resin or insulin, the current dosage of the sulfonylium or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulphonate resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripleotherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonystick, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered in doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonystick was reduced by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who additionally took Actos in addition to insulin, reported a reduction in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesthesia (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the placing of orders in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzyme values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms related to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overweight problems, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be guided by the clinical assessment by the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases it is associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) was reduced as a result of haemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparable controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients under sulfonyllium and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonystick or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, Thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes to be pregnant or that occurs, the treatment is stopped (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductinhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of the AUC of pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the lens and the refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone ALT-ascents over the three-fold of the upper limit of the normal range also often appeared as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl harnmaterial.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-g (PPAR-g)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the start of therapy a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of a three-month optimization phase with insulin, were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to patients receiving insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin quotients showed a significant statistically significant decrease of the albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, whereas values decreased in metformin and gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the low triglycerides but also improved the post-denodically increased triglyceride levels, this both by an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups that received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that pioglitazone does not have any relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked Pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the waste (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than in healthy subjects in patients with reduced kidney function, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophie occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsuline and elevated insulin resistance of the uterus decreases and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment led to an increased frequency of colontumors with two other Thiazolidindions.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / Kreatinin quotients showed a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the low triglycerides but also improved the post-denodically increased triglyceride level, this both by an effect on Tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-kyocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary Revascularization and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that long-term risks associated with the intake of pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy may change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in respect to strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphase, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA over insulin origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required during the change to Actimphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-controlled diabetes treatment, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Nervous system disorders - peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are known as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of blood sugar level may however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Illnesses of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue Jelly - Lipodystrophy On the injection site can develop a lipodystrophy if failed to change the instipation within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General ailments and complaints at the administration of the administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection site).</seg>
<seg id="885">Illnesses of the immune system Gelegingly - Urtikaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar-containing foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of hydrolysis (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the division is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and for reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspated according to the instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 A intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement of blood sugar level may however be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminal half-life (t ½) is therefore more a measure of resorption as a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes in the bloodstream).</seg>

<seg id="1176">Compared to that, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and in no of 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart problems in prehistory, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective in reducing the uric acid level in the blood than allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and the blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits (including one of the currently known or currently available gout nodes and / or gout arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum harnar acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function restriction, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Transplant Receivers Since there are no experiences in organ transplant recipients, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this patient group (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other drug-like medicines, a acute gout attack can occur during the treatment beginning, because the reduction of the serum harnacid saw must first mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in case of malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-syndrome), the absolute concentration of xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that there is a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During clinical studies of phase 3, slight abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the Febuxostattreatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyll in Zeous did not have any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO-hibition can lead to an increase in theophyllinic mirror (an inhibition of the metabolism of Theophyllin was also reported for other XO-inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily associated with an increase in Febuxostatexposition (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily measured an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in the CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregnancies can not be ruled out on the side effects of Febuxostat on the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect detrimental effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or when carrying out dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall study group in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an atherosclerotic disorder and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Febuxostat and reported in all Febuxostat treatment groups a total of more than once, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Colchicin. * * In clinical studies no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 trials (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported in all Febuxostat- treatment groups a total of more than once and occurred in patients receiving Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patients years), according to the indications occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypnosis, conspicuous ECG, coughing, shortness of skin, skin irritation, bursitis, protein urie, kidney failure, erectile dysfunction, rise in the blood, decrease of lymphocyte, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction process hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a powerful, non-Purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki value for in vitro inhibiting, which is below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1.832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly specified serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 268), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum incremental value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX-study showed the statistically significant superiority of both ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed a statistically significant superiority in the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum carcinoma &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were combined for the analysis. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">The reduction of the serum harnage acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum carcinoma &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with renal function restriction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum harnar acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of their kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnar acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of the patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum harnar concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open renewal study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the serum harnar acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients in the months 16-24 needed treatment against a gout surge (i.e. more than 97% of the patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the gout node size, resulting in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the gums by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxeastat after administration were easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the CMAx amounts to approximately 2,8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum harnar concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) by Febuxostat lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration width, which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatescoronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-Marked Febuxostat, about 49% of the dose found in the urine as immutable Febuxostat (3%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (13%) and as further unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as immutable Febuxostat (12%), the Acylglucoronid of the drug (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and its conjugate (25%) and as further unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (ChildPugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh-Classification B) Liver function restriction, the CMAx and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after taking multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papillomas and carcinoma) was found only in connection with xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, such as the 3-fold human-therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, accompanied by a decrease in breeding performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with expositions, approximately the 4.3-fold and in carrying rabbits with expositions, which amounted to about 13 times the human-therapeutic exposure, did not have teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without requiring a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient used at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Colchicin. * * In clinical studies no severe skin rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>

<seg id="1254">In some people uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid becomes insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low by 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystals is prevented and a reduction of the discomfort is reached with time.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be used, if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the ingredients of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Tell your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart weakness or had or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you are treated with a high uric acid concentration in a result of cancer or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a poison attack at the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, heat and joint swelling), wait until the poison drop is cleared before you start treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but could also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, when you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe you other medicines if necessary to prevent a gout attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines / apply or have been taken recently / used even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply any of the substances listed below, since interactions with ADENURIC may appear and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures. • Azathioprine (for the treatment of asthma) • Theophyllin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">No studies have been carried out on the effects of ADENURIC on traffic safety and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>

<seg id="1275">ADROVANCE is used to treat osteoporosis (a disease in which the bones become brittle) in women after menopause, where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day, the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicates that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsy (diarrhoea), ulcer (Ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagia (swallowing), inflamed abdomen (blower abdomen) as well as acid rearing.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against algae dronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE should not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be applied in case of diseases of the oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1285">In January 2007, the European Commission informed Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. to approve ADROVANCE in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only available with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or taking of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Follow the instructions below to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • The patients should not crush the tablet or crush the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty, only be given under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, ösophageal Ulzera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by ösophageal lines, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that point out possible ösophageal reactions, and patients should be noted in the occurrence of symptoms of ophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrobulding heartburn or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an abophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Although no increased risk was detected in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate, stomach and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoporosis of the jaw, commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose therapist contains predominantly intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a slate-surgical procedure will reduce the risk of osteoporosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after they have noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">They should not take two tablets the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned on the day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral drugs may interfere with the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast-feeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoporosis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but also in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, absorption of serum calcium was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or a resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressant therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or hyperimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level characteristics (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus valley level should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both levels of kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talents are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advaginal therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Additional dosage adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilisation of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advaginal therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf must be changed a transplant receiver of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to once daily intake of advagraf, so this conversion has to be done in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplantation should begin for prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are switched to Advagraf, an oral Initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in lung, pankatic and colorectal transplants, in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal transplant patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the target range, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the Nephrotoxic potentiometer of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum increment level, a calculation of the creatine capacity and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In the transition from a ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advised caution (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus tallow levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls of the tacrolimus valley levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood sugar levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from prograf to advagraf, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could alter the tacrolimus blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases, if the levels of blood are not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the sebaceous levels of Tacrolimus usually lie in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has resulted in serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects caused by tacrolimus sub- or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retardiated formulation of Advagraf for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult cardiac transplant recipients and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimuscle levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies can be avoided during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimuscle concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases an aqueous or septum hypertrophie was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolim blood mirrors with simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism, and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of Tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly doped prednisolon or methyl prednisolon, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, decisions about contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that Tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies in transplant patients do not indicate that in the comparison to other immunosuppressants, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>
<seg id="1460">There is the risk of premature birth (&lt; week 37) and a hyperaemia of the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 newborns, i.e.:</seg>
<seg id="1461">The side effect profile of immunosuppressants is often difficult to determine because of the patient's disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1462">In the following, the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order: very often (≥ 1 / 100, ≤ 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), very rare (≤ 1 / 10,000, ≤ 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1463">Ischemic disturbances of coronary arteries, tachycardia chamber arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, heart failure, myocardiopathy, aqueous hypertrophie, supraventricular arrhythmia, palpitatio, anomalies in ECG, abnormal heart rate and pulse rate</seg>
<seg id="1464">Diarrhoea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal ulcer and perforation, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, stomatitis and ulceration, aszites, vomiting, pain in the gastrointestinal region and abdomen, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, obstipation, signs and symptoms in the gastrointestinal area</seg>
<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As known to other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus are often increased the susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of Nephropathy and JC virus-associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppressant therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with the treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialymable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus should be mediated by its binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction paths in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain line of lymphoma genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on the T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and g -interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant receivers.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, transplant loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Advagraf group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lunged patients, 475 patients undergoing pancreatitis and in 630 cases after a colon transplantation were used as a primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">An interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf was reported in more than 110 patients receiving either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliteration syndrome, was seen less frequently in the first year following the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacroliar and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans was compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients killed by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the incidence of a bronchiolitis obliteration syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplant A multicentre study with oral prograf was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancreatic and renal transplantation which received a randomized trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired level of sebum from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colon transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric trial with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantation showed in 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisal transplantation) under Tacrolimus and Prednisone an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus leading to Talents between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recent transplant radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can be noted that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated with Prograf (once a day) on Advagraf (once a day) in the ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the deficiency of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method known as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers to the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Baxter AG company in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity is not to fall under the specified plasmural level (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients less than 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients less than 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment it is recommended to control the dosage and frequency of injections an appropriate determination of the Factor VIII plasma label.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in response to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and show different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activities are not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be based on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the pro-coagulatory activity of Factor VIII directed by IgG Immunglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all previously untreated patients with higher risk of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII mirror in the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) found a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial were 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as persistent peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated that were referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the incidence of urticaria, uritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes has been reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months required, that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company regains its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of female Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene which is not defective in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient who performed Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the abdomen of the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP will generate a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it has not been adequately proven that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumours will bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not prove sufficient evidence that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way, and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other is slowly released for a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous membrane swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aeropaze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clapped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients took their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving disloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), oral dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (helplessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (somnia), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (other medicines used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may not be used in patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), heart or vascular disease, including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (cerebral stroke), or risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe Company to introduce aeroplanes in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking it, to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the absence of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1), Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, cabergolin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data do not suffice to give appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aeropaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to give appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be cancelled in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeropaze is at least 48 hours prior to performing dermatological tests, because antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo CYP3A4 is not inhibited in-vivo CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The persistence of the use of aerosol during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that can lead to impairment of traffic safety or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letteral processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouthdry, pupil stiffness and dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of adhesion molecules P seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the glider, including the reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily did not detect increased incidence of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other sympathetic effects such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerobaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aeropaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) by pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was to exposition after administration of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety margin, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin could not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicology studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and the pharmaceutical vigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tears or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you are diagnosed or diagnosed with the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • Heart hunt, palpitations • cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take an aerea with other medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Use in recommended dosage is not to be expected that Aerinaze will lead to drowsiness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerobaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you have forgotten taking Aerinaze if you have forgotten to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and contact the next dose at the intended time.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscle pain, seizures, somnia with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver and over cases of conspicuous liver flukes, has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilizate to take (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between 6 and 11 years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by identifying symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom (symptom point) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria, the decline in symptom scores after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted to the SP Europe Company a permit for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience of clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the current illness course and can be resumed after the symptoms of the symptoms and are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the reduction of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that can lead to impairment of traffic safety or ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo reported fatigue (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with a loratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were given.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of adhesion molecules P seltin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered over ten days in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-times the clinical dose) was given over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the glider, including the reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the different forms of pathophysiology, and chronic patients can be recruited easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamination is a causative factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that, besides the chronic idiopathic urticaria, disinfection leads to an improvement of the symptoms in other forms of the urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of paddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminics in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistaminika were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with loratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patient demos were comparable with the general seasonally allergic rhinitis population, a higher concentration of Desloratadin was achieved in 4% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant grief after once daily use of Desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded altogether.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin could not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis are caused by infection in children under 2 years of age (see section 4.4) and there are no data available to support the treatment of a infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Around 6% of adults and children between the ages of 2 and 11 are subject to diminishing and experienced a higher substance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years of age that can be limited is identical to that of children that are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinically pharmacological study, intake of Aerius tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose was 3% more adverse events reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, at which up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were given.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti-histamine therapy received a daily dose of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years old) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children is similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated in adults.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-times the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not detect increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not affect psychomotors.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an amplification of alcohol-induced performance impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and youthful patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of paddling at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children from 2 to 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger with black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasia (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis that are restricted.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active substance-grief after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 different single dose studies showed that AUC and CMAx values were comparable in pediatric patients at the recommended doses with those of adults who received the loratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain arises from the flu virus, which can easily spread from man to person, because people have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane manure of the virus was removed with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognises as foreign), cleaned up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, infected with the Human Immunodeficiency virus of type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution to take-in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination is not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aspiration should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral drug the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aspirin depends on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenera reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenera was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug used with low-dose kriton avir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared with placebo, but Agenera was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenera reinforced the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenera combined with Ritonavir to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenera (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amalgam or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aspiration may also not be used in patients who take St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or pharmaceuticals that are also degraded in the same way as Agenera and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who occupy Agenera are taking the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenera in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children were outweighed over four years versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenera is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee concluded that the benefit of aspirin in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenera was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because only limited information was presented at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted approval to the Glaxo Group Limited for the placing of Agenera in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Aspirin is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenera capsules should be given to the pharmacokinetic booths of Amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprener as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprener as capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenera capsules are used without the addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 20 mg Amprener / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aspirin in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenera is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenera capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with severe liver dysfunction, and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenera must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations which contain St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenera does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenera capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver failure under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocosteroids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the annex function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of aspirin with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenera can be less effective because of reduced plasma gas (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amalgam, patients should therefore be monitored on ompiatentment symptoms, especially when low doses of Ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoly content of the Agenera solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aspiration should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exfoliation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">For Hammophiles patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with a severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial eology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenera must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects for increased plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient is already taking St. John's wort, the prenatal mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprener (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, on the other hand, 30% lower for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprener (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosine, however, due to the fantasy component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosine and Agenera are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">This is why in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, be careful; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be undertaken, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, thereby increasing the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with aspirin, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenera in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazol once a day led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-stress) to 2.69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazol once a day without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions in common with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as aspirin, since it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Amprener.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent intake with Agenera can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of study subjects, the fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol declined by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenera with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive elevations of the plasma can be expected with simultaneous administration of Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma levels increase this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with Ampreneolyr.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenera may not be used together with an orally-recorded midazolam (see section 4.3) while careful use of Agenera with parenteral midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors point to a possible increase in plasma levels from Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is given together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on ompiatentment symptoms, especially when low doses of Ritonavir are given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, such as the Amprenavir- dose, when Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenera, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During the pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amalgavir related substances have been detected in the milk of lactation rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given by the introduction to the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding time, Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breast feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenera was investigated in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderately pronounced, rose early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not clarified whether they are related to the use of Agenera or another medicine applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where protease inhibitors did not receive pretreated patients 1200 mg Agenera twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with study media and were performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and potential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophie of breasts and dorsal liposal liposuction.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated subjects treated with Amprenavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovuddin for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stickers) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients underwent 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually slightly up to moderately pronounced, erythematous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be canceled with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecsis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with a severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg Agenera twice a day together with low-dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), species and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were very common in patients who received agenerations together with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting action.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteinlevels with the consequence of an formation of non-infectious, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of Amprener lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM with Chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, such mutations described in other Ritonavir were rarely observed with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 anti-retroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprener with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, M36I, M46I / L, I47V, G48V, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension of APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors performed over 96 weeks in patients with following protease inhibitor mutations:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of specific mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testings can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir's associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amalgam and other protease inhibitors for all 4 types of fossils, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral previously untreated patients in which a Fosamprenavir and Saquinavir (one of them showed resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at treatment start and another against tidal caviar), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Inversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenera in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which Agenera (600 mg twice daily) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a low dose of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-subority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-adjusted average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-sub-threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of untreated Agenera is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera solution for taking and capsules was examined three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefit of" "" "unbooked" "" "aspirin should be considered during therapy optimisation with PI pre-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) amounts to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprener with a meal results in a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady-state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unconnected amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenatal remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates in dependence on the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when given at the same time with aspirin (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenera capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amalgam exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is a solution of 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenera's solution and Agenera capsules are not replaceable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a renal function disorder is likely to be low on the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenatal plasma levels comparable to those that are achieved on healthy volunteers at a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatellular adenomas were present in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatellular adenomas and carcinoma has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the actual exposure data to humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there were little hints for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo and In-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes included, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of aspirin nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles who were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In case of systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyme ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed which indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenera capsules are used without the addition of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenera capsules is 20 mg Amprener / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin-values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprener (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are used together, be careful; thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be undertaken, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with aspirin, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Nicardipin, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil may be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of study subjects, the fluorticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol declined by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenera, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are formed after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since no data is available for long term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in the case of superficially basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">No clinical experience is available in patients with relapsed and pre-treated BCCs. therefore, the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is less likelihood of response to iodine-iodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of acute keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Only very limited data is available about the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of acute Keratosen in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study suggest that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not achieved after a unique topical application (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during breast feeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently shared and probable or possibly with the application of Imiquimod cream related side effects in the studies with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the Feignizen (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and reported as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream associated with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The effects reported by 185 with imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probable or possibly associated side effect with the application of the Imiquimod cream in these studies were a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects, which were given from 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimiodine cream, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod cream, it frequently came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), erosion (23%), and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen by the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe deformation and calisation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies for the treatment of Imiquimodine for the treatment of the actin-keratose, Alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent one-time oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotony, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines have been detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies showed that efficacy is clearly superior to a complete healing of the Feignizen in an Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients with Imiquimod, the patients were fully healed; this was in the case of 20% of the 105 with placebo treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 treated with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-colour treatments per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficially basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was investigated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic Ak- lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 large treatment area on the unhairy scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The six-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment rooms.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external Feignizen, acute keratose and superficiency basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, Placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic absorption of the 5% imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratose was observed during the three weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on the systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod after topical application on MC-diseased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at rat doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for four months for the dermal application showed no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice when administered three days a week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has a slight systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for the human being to be considered very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice that were treated with the active cream, earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharisocket I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycanes, gags) are not degraded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the motions complicate, reduced pulmonary volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">For children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied to patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year all new information that may be known, check and update this summary whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme manufactures patients who receive aldurazyms in response to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to move Aldurazyme to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharisocket I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, to increase all 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting, in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, nearly all patients are IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience in resumption of treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment, precautions must be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="2296">To treat the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistaminika and / or anti-pyretic).</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion reaction, the treatment should be weighed with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduce the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminica and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time with chloroquine or procain because there is a potential risk of interferenz with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase above breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions associated with Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children undesirable drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe liveform and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a seroconversion, whereby it occurred in patients at the age of 5 years with a heavier waveform (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or up to early retirement from the study), no antibodies (RIP) assay were detectable in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom it never came to a Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with abrupt or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to interfere with clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, the most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the average phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute ear test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement of the lung function and the capacity shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the height of the children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with an Hepathegaly before treatment 22 (85%) had a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, which summarizes clinically significant changes across five efficacy-variable (expected percentage normal FEV, range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe slump form and 4 with an average circulation form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe circulatory form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the average circulation form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe circulatory form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development was to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme-dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute-test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - dilution and application The concentrate for the production of an infusion solution must be diluted before application and is intended for intravenous use (see information for doctors or medical specialists).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerate this, gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and facial oils.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • skin rash • joints disorders, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • reddening • Hypertension • Hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer of cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and "malignant" (malignant "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who haven't been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a lack of fluid) should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural relief, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months in the treatment of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the mean survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cells during the administration of Alimta showed longer survival compared to the same medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to move Alimta to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with previously advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed administration and the day after the treatment a corticosteroid must be given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third movement cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a full blood picture should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be canceled if in patients after 2 dose-reductive nuclei a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no clue that in patients with age 65 years or above, compared to patients at age 65 years, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose calculations were necessary in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose-adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper bilirubin value and / or transaminase values (in liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients have to be monitored with regard to bone marital immunosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils drop a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils number, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-matologic toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered when a preliminary treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent consumption of non-steroidal antiphloistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for which a therapy is provided with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, in which these events occurred, had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion can be weighed before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed when this active ingredient was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible fostering of reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment bed to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phloistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid are applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piroxicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the immune status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulas.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as in the case of anred- or antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be applied during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the closure of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate that exerts its effect by interrupting weight-sensitive metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidyspsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis by thymidin- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin for chemonaided patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically significant benefit of patients who were treated with cisplatin only with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rarely (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects observed after the Orlistat market launch is unknown because these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies it can be assumed that any systemic effects caused by orlistat's lipasinhibiting properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect consists in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serum-rest of gastran and pankreatic lipassions.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalor, fetal-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of the body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was orlistat 60 mg -3,5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, in the case of therapeutic doses, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of an accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two major metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-formyl-leucine group), were identified in a study with adipous patients, which represented approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alohxi is used in chemotherapy, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), and chemotherapy, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroid (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three major studies, Aloxi was studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the firm of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emitted chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emitted chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emitted chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroid given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs tested against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady-static concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, chlorpromaine, Cimetidine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of palonosetron in human gestation is not possible, so palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups showed themselves; there were no dose-effective relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy with Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of palonosetron (half-life 4 hours) or 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given, given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blind study, 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron which were given day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of i.v. approved palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed in the entire dose range of 0,3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to the intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall composition achieved once daily intake of 0.25 mg palonosetron on 3 consecutive days was comparable with the value measured after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher than 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the isobics CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered agent made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection, the total body weight was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver function disorders, the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies effects were observed only by expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggesting that palonosetron can only block Ionic channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose accounted for about 30times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses of dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for unique application, the relevance of these results is very low.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference doctor" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damages, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study in patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of reference drug treatment to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study showed how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been voiced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was retarded by more patients than the reference drug, and Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study used in the study to investigate the question of how far the medicine is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients at the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the skin area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was stopped after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo said treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were considered together with Hautwunden, about 90% of patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should also be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitizing or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary uninfected open wounds the efficacy of retinulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered when no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinulin and other topical means on the same skin area is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skewed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adjustments are not considered necessary when topical retinotulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding should be continued / ended or the therapy should be continued / ended with Altargo, between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo applied, the most commonly reported side effect irritation was at the place of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passaperianus (formerly Purotus passaperianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The action mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial reef which distinguishes itself from the binding of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should a consultation by experts should be considered due to the local prevalence of resistance to the application of retinulin at at least some types of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of retinotulin compared to S.aureus were detected, regardless of whether the isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and stripped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skewed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid alterations.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro check for gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was reached than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skilted skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (decreased body weight of fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the authorization for the market must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 module of the application for authorisation (version 6.2), works before the product is marketed and the marketed product is applied as long as the product is marketed.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged 1 to 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "Ambirix will be applied as part of a vaccination plan existing in two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is taken." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a small risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same constituents as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twinrix's children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix are also used as proof of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix applied for a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix in a six-month and a 12 month distance between injections was similar.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine cans) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, maternity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the arrival of Ambirix throughout the entire country.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priorization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If you wish to vaccinate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured whether immunocompetent individuals who responded to a hepatitis C vaccination need a conceptualization as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the administration of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formal hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels may be achieved after primer synthesis, so that in these cases the administration of additional vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal inocclusion, these injection channels should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, however, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneous because in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mason mumps-rocking vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines in this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former Thiomersal- and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of ambient environment was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturities on a calculation basis per vaccination dose ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to the overall vaccination cycle (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and matchiness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose-combination vaccine with 360-ELISA-units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combinationvaccine with three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was valuable, the Seroprotectants (SP in the table below) were significantly higher than with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the 3-dose-imp substance.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses found in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination pattern with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formal inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">At the time of priming between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of deactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>

<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the crafting of a combined Diphtherian, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not be completely protected from infection with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B viruses, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis C or Hepatitis B virus before the two vaccines ambivalence is / is (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that may damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself through itchy skin rashes, shortness or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child has already experienced an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a serious infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of an inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccine against ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes ambient conditions for people suffering from severe blood clots are injected under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body's defences / / or if you / your child undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you take another medicine (including those which you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has been given / or immunoglobulins (antibodies) have received / has or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambiance, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nevertheless sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2797">♦ A very common case (more than 1 case per 10 implanted cans): • pain or discomfort at the insertion site or redness • Matity • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ A case (up to 1 case per 10 injected cans): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • Use rate • gastrointestinal complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B very rarely (less than 1 case per 10,000 reported cans) have been reported are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extensive rashes which can be itchy or inflated, swelling of the eye area and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has been known since the first permit for the placing of the market, the CHMP argued that the benefit-risk ratio for ambivalence remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has only been put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with an incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided into several single doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without an active agent).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammontaps can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste-massage, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifests form (incomplete enzyme defect which manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication of the use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy exists in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifests deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or Orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because Metabolization and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys occur, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans in breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breast feeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not connected to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, artery disease, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred during a 5 month old toddler with an accidental one dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms begin with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during the intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound formed by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of bibutyl butyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set up early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Haemodialysis, the use of alternative means of nitrogen separation (sodium polybutyl butyl, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (but within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism, and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium polyphenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral one dose of 5 g sodium polybutyl butyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable on the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjuded product phenylacetylglutamine above the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus testing, sodium phenylbutyrat had no clear effects with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules are either taken orally (infants and children not yet able to swallow tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifests deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or Orniintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-turtles were subjected to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) before the birth, there were lesions in the pyramids of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old abnormal patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acid, severe hypokalemia, artery disease, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Psychometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram of recorded sodium polyphenylates between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral one dose of 5 g sodium polybutyl butyrat in granule form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon is 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium polybutyl butyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium butyl butyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium polyphenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breast-feeding, you may not use AMMONAPS, as the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, impairment of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to discharge appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different starch) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measuring value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If anox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is given and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain the flow of blood to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin was compared with a single gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulan) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often became a stem (a short tube left in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, anox - with or without a gift from GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or one year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in terms of all indicators, except in severe bleeding where it was much more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other Hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for leparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (instabile Angina / non-ST-uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolus release of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolus release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration by Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal failure (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg / kg can be administered and the ACT once again check 5 minutes after the second bolus dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intravenous administration of unfractional leparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Immediately hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against deer • active bleedings or increased blood risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible effects. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most hemorrhages in arterial punctures occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can generally cause bleeding throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivalirudin is again achieved before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivaliruine with thrombocyte aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters in each case are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractional leparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bivalirudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood flow, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrhage isations that occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, women and in patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent in Bivalirudin than in the comparison group at Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organclasses in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken off and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivaliruine, a direct and specific Thrombin inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic centre and the anion binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is present in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on its part splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, it was possible to induce no thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombose Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose-based and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is documented by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day and the 1- annual endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients receiving aspirin and clopids according to protocol (prior to angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopids before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-Neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, Reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-fold and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing coronary coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide has a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the division of the ARG3-Pro4-binding of the N-terminal sequence by thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a process of first order with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies of safety-harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproduction oxicity, the preclinical data cannot recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The toxicity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks in an exposition up to 10-fold of the clinical steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects caused by a longer-term physiological stress in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical application, even at a much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution is not produced under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In a study of 878 adults, Apidra was studied for type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lipo was detected after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when given together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the permissal of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced Glukoneogenesis Capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin need in patients with a restriction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the strength of the insulin, the brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production can undergo a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar reduction and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-Converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be weakened or absent under the effect of sympathizers such as beta-blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidine and Reserpin.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin enters human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed from clinical studies of undesirable drug responses, grouped according to system organclasses and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration disturbances, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If foamed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous doses of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause for severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous injection of insulin lulisin the effect of action occurs more quickly and the duration of action is shorter than in the normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male patients between 21 and 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin in the therapeutic dosage range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect of action like normal human insulin and achieves complete glucose-giving effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-pranic glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was found 2 minutes before the meal, a better postoperative control was reached than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, such as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 grooves in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at administration 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin, which was 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) prior to the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin in administration 15 minutes (GLULISIN - hereafter) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
