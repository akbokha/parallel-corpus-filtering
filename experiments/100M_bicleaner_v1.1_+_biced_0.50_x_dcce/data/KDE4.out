package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Add @-@ ons .... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed on your system , you may have more modules installed on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Fig@@ ures . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if available .
the view filter module ( also called Ord@@ ner@@ filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to show ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , you can easily detect large files , even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color coding and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the easy detection of the sh@@ ading depth or the image of another file name , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it will be displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les is to be used ( whereby representation errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ tangle .
in case of representation algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target will not always be comp@@ lied with . it will draw frames to prevent the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tangle is quad@@ ratic .
as division of an area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation remains . here it is always advantageous for the label and to avoid space losses by frame , that rectang@@ les are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimal displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View An@@ keeping on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the Image Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you call the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a dialog box will open which allows you to specify the image of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option Tit@@ le of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a rotary field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .

an easy to use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .... This will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam , and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ tization ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ tization ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and database . simply enter the name of the path or click the Fol@@ der icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your machine . here the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; look at any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . while browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam , recur@@ sively search the library path in its full depth . you can not exclude sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by adding a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ tization ; possibly also around it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu aid .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Options and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy to use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk device . the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions over the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not have to look for thumb@@ nails or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . for example , filtering on the filen@@ ame will only work when it displays a symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos , which are stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . choose album Import images to it . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and album features allowing you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties from the context menu .
album Coll@@ ections : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by collection from the toolbar or view albums Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort .
buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Year : these put the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do so , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be swal@@ lowed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . to the collection are always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you must wait for a short while , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each picture is displayed below the preview . what information is this , you can change the digi@@ tization ; set it up . select the albums page and adjust the preview image to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment on a picture . the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can view all the features that are with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the file type sub@@ menu . to do so , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur . some programs do not save this data when you save the changed image . this will result in the loss of this information from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for turning . the simplest one is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click the preview button and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete it , it will be moved to the tr@@ ash bin ; F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My punc@@ tu@@ ation quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords in loss of the database are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or to an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have a new keyword , this keyword will be used for the sub@@ stit@@ uting of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the key word in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nail preview and select from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be shown in the main window under the thumb@@ nail of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the photos context menu with the right mouse button . the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower right of the select frame , which displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click on it the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters what you have entered as search criteria .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select a search , the search form will appear to enter the search information previously entered . if you select Advanced Search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to be compared by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ book , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the unused search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hand @-@ made colour sket@@ ches : draw a quick sketch and / or digi@@ tization ; find the appropriate images . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen . if you select preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or Shi@@ ps operations on one of the images , then you will be able to compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use pairs of pairs from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 File Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available in the light table for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click on it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview then both images will show the same image area .
the zoom works exactly as in other views . simply use the zoom slider under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the picture . this is done in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , edit , edit , edit , edit , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assembled and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need no longer to find a particular photo . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will definitely not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats freely .
the first thing you need to do and know before you do something in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend to store metadata in the site of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; enable it to enable EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data to be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so &amp; digi@@ kam , provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos at work .
let us now with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or add the images to the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are removed from &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are characteristics of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos easily , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming , associations , memories , the historic period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help Him about the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported according to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now moves with light speed .
the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will continue to be deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files which you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be stored as information : &quot; &quot; &quot;
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working description of the photographer . examples of this can be title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be completed .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the image is a stock picture , then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; a module for batch processing will be available in the near future .
topics : plate errors , plate failures , electric shocks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . this kind of losses are the same as you can also pass on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protective aging , they are caused by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from corrupted disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good record device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ex@@ propri@@ ate format . also , read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected environment . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
your manufacturer &apos;s tools include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available : disk failure study
soon : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temper@@ a , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of electrical current , it differs from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection then you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also watch out that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to even continue to work until the current exp@@ ires . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard on a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has not been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , TA@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deterior@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . back up your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget an aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data .
therefore , disaster prepar@@ edness means always a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or the like .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for data loss in spite of backing up panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : the total backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes next to an version@@ ing system , except that it is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between the files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , original hold , memory , scal@@ ability , media , res@@ ize images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the period of time you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to be a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printer for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let us assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the file if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if there is no software available that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save a lot more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that it is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data in a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP also fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera image , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you are editing the images again with &amp; digi@@ tization ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and switch it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera appear . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are shown on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , Manufac@@ turers , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected button . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these pictures have not been downloaded by now . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the buttons All download or download selected , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folder is sorted , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by er@@ asing the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only a few , you need to select them first and use the delete selected afterwards .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album are downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera completely , you should do this via the camera system because this is much faster .
cameras often do not use a particularly meaningful name for the photos . the filen@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is automatically created per day .
the first two affect the data about the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S . turn off the date &amp; time option . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo is displayed under the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window the next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually enabled , and if your camera does not provide this information , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom panel of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can use it to automatically load sub @-@ albums in the target album . all the pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a Data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off , and in this case save &amp; digi@@ tization ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ section at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image cho@@ oser is done , &amp; digi@@ kam , you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ - and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photography it can be interesting to associate a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to carto@@ graphi@@ cally an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; user want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to add the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data go into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers and map references . the question is actually more about how the data entered into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save this data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters of ha@@ iry coordinates that are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings menu ; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you will set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; be sure to click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be descriptions such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a stock picture , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images store : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that will not have any of these extensions , by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; quot ; can be set to the default values on this page . each time you open the light table these settings are not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use on fast machines . if you have one then you can get better view results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or brigh@@ ter color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect image quality because the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of detail . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images gain more details in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your pictures that are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to view the pointed lights . use the setting through white in the settings . the setting colors will generate some unusual results , as it shows the pointed lights in various ros@@ at@@ ars . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satur@@ ating like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ tive option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ us Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dient correction as you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate is thus the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior issues when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color profile folder Click here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam , then examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ administr@@ ated not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not fixed for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color mapping yourself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile to em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . this could be done manually instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obviously what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ came ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you can also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Set@@ ting short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adjust@@ s the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the Camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option Con@@ fir@@ mation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting a photos and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also add &amp; digi@@ tise the display of the greeting screen ; under certain circumstances , this acceler@@ ates the starting process from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ tization ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam , you will see if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry View / Edit .
the image editing includes a set of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the filen@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save .
almost every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit back or Rest@@ ore , by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should get the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl + -@@ Z for the return and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ covering .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the Return or Rest@@ ore button on the toolbar a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : automatically select the magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will see the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar will be displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the Settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ kam ; see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the menu album . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again into the edge .
in the cap@@ tion view you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ ly button or just change to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
next to the App@@ ly button , there is a button Learn More . however , you can also read the metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also edit the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ tization ; -@@ session used keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , these are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be placed in the tree by marking the appropriate check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the Key@@ word Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search view is used . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the keyword exists already , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is on no keywords which the amount is reduced to three images . you were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have to be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come with predictable deviations from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ .@@ In addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to alli@@ g@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . so , when you work in RGB mode , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a fitting monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , compare , Automati@@ cally balance and contrast from the correction menu Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the leu@@ k@@ strengthened values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
like this : this method adjust@@ s the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces garbage . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
add contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white @-@ balance correction is somewhat limited because it is working over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better eliminated .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry color white balance of the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right , a hist@@ ogram shows that when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow read@@ just@@ ment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save as and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you set can save you to a text file and download it later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the default settings return all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gra@@ dation tool that you will find under Col@@ ours Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar heating effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ion@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar heating effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ bel@@ lish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ ders repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too great satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool has a tone correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the intended purpose .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynamic , updated based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often the most useful . in this case the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , remedies and sol@@ utes . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified which is changed by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most useful . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a cur@@ tail to the right , e.g. the light notes , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the associated image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . any curve that you created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview , and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance the image will retain the overall brightness even if you also change the color components . this is especially convenient if you also use the Mon@@ och@@ rome option , because the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . color space consists of small space files that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green line filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scene and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm and medium tones while adding a bit of col@@ dness into the t@@ att@@ oos . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam , apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a m@@ ural on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the picture surrounds it with a thin line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool sten@@ cil you can put a template over a picture .
the Image Processing menu apply in image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template from &amp; digi@@ kam , please send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional sharpen@@ ing tool . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . elements smaller than the resolution are therefore framed to a common color . this in turn leads to sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more cre@@ mat@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG images , a camera has often been used internally . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a field of depth while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing work suit . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ er Dep@@ th .
you should carefully deal with this , since the results are not very natural : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique is re@@ focusing the tool . you can re@@ focus on the menu entry Cor@@ rection . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much simpler than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rection sof@@ tness and experiment with something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove mu@@ cous from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount . thus , one can define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpen@@ ing and therefore avoided f@@ laws in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted deco@@ ding filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ explanation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus achieved mostly better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circuit @-@ shaped folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ les , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 very rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is G@@ auss . this is most often caused by a previously executed blur@@ ring filter . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more re@@ focused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but will later leave uncomfortable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you are reading and compressed images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the inability to mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original non @-@ sharp paint image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the smo@@ othing regul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homogen@@ ous regions smo@@ othing and detail@@ ing details . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is subsequently necessary .
direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD space a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 .
smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect , it must be placed higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed through . usually , it is enough for 1 or 2 .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never t@@ aller than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor , but it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to let him out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save as and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window will remain in the default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ b the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller f@@ laws cleaned .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focus level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing to the front to detect light density changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter &apos;s frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can &apos;t be removed or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more obsc@@ ured , to increase .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase absorption . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear sli@@ pper@@ y , when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the parameters for noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rection sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sion@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the save as and loading buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button .
below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is being restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is visible under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and see the filter results . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
Dur@@ section : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ mode . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic graphs ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the ir@@ is filter , which may possibly increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by applying an equi@@ valence transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the net@@ ting correction filter and with three more expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of illumination loss at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with an aperture of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the gra@@ ding correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regulator only provides you with positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the correction of vig@@ net@@ ting on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ sen@@ distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second gra@@ dient treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar conc@@ entri@@ c effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth density correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second count . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion of the fourth degree . this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the in@@ verse sign of the general .
zoom : this value res@@ scales the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
light : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction should be performed before any changes in size or size . best perform this correction as the first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a rec@@ tal correction , the effect appears to be the false .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them from the editing tool from the image editing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the correction of the correction to a church in Norway . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters set movie grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film grain if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter code applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of photo emul@@ sion .
the movie grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal ze . the lines that define the outline in drawing are stressed . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam , filter en@@ grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ ocular landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 , the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radial Un@@ sharpen@@ ing : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photographs , camera .
sof@@ tness blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sc@@ attering sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent sharp@@ ness : finds the colour basin in the picture and blur@@ red it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops to your image . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ke filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation .
blowing photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how you can infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values .
the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be placed higher than 3 .
the save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ utter for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and later loaded .
blowing photo is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button .
you can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool for comp@@ iling a picture . to trim a photo , simply drag the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rec@@ tangle . you &apos;ll see this rec@@ tangle as you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the picture will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle will create by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button the editing button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the Save or Save file entries in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or trans@@ verse format . in portrait mode , the greater value of the height and in the trans@@ verse format is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inch or any other physical size . you can see , for example , a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio cuts the settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the integration aids settings allow you to fade in Help so that you can put together your images better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ organ , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle in similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden middle is a division which is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third organ , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the viewer &apos;s view along the lines of the spiral and creates a sym@@ metric visual flow on this type .
a further rule are the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . this rectang@@ les are used to make the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is in the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without guiding the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be made a static object dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the transformation function from the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the turn . but keep in mind the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas generated by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
corner right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is bl@@ ended a little . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adjusted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ations cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer sciss@@ ors .
she@@ ar your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two sho@@ ot@@ ings are twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ations cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that you know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the image editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept . in the configuration section you will find further information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contains more than 200 raw file formats supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the avi or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understand these formats and will preview for the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam , but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings for playback movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need for photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform type of dialog which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontally divided without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to the comparison the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . press C@@ trl , left mouse button to draw a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallet files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the range next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is selected under the color button , the color will be inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing mode is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line sign , if another color follows . if so , three numerical values are in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are out@@ dated according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graphs ; represents )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; -@@ component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knots )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ not ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . needs are :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file was edited by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Gra@@ ph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphs ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside of a current &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; c@@ x@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but you can also change it with the setup dialog .
during program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut loading page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or request the program every time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time will be asked .
the session administration page gives you the ability to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears in a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm inserts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it produces representations according to the spring@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spring@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ wire sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell . the command should specify the graph@@ ene file as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph according to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can specify &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Algorith@@ ms before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ved ) and applies the standard algorithm for the specific type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; displays the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What is the mouse poin@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; click on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; GUI &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get further help to this element ( if available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the san@@ e project or any other source such as video streams . to make this work you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry Pictures , a dialog box appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window will be displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button , wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will be able to read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is basically your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will see the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the Export module is launched to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all other options set . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , you can start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the permissions on your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before the upload in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size will change so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS lane as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic localization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog top to see appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alisation , you must load a track file with a GP@@ X file . this file , of course , contains data that were taken at the same location at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera location must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera system . if the deviation is below , the data is combined . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations for inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog moves the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the shown map . select the region in question and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the map can be selected manually between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the album preview and the text in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the overall look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each picture to create a page creates a new page in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with Other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it has been developed for a fast image display and fast access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , as no compression of color information occurs . this can be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Climate is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the metadata editor &apos;s K@@ IP@@ I module currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to select the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG En@@ co@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module also uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image gallery . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . afterwards , you can create the module via extras MPEG slideshow .
the images you selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . if possible , keep the suff@@ ix mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all the settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quickly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back again .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages via the Settings right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG , TIFF , or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with cra@@ ps ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue using it , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the option to automatically over@@ write the existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sing .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ code and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can zoom or enlarge the image . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
propor@@ tionally ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to customize your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be scanned in advance .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add additional images using the Add button . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Pictures button , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
take care not to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be merged into a text file and sent to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss@@ less formats like TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ x will be added to the images that are being sent .
when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you would like to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant passes through Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the option filen@@ ame indicates that the filen@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . so it &apos;s not the order of the pictures used in the album .
between the pictures , the time distance between the pictures can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . acci@@ dentally select a different effect between the pictures .
during the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse in this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next image and stop the slideshow .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date Adjust@@ s currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop interface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have given your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your range .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined . see the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view , for example , symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to select which image to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to select the image @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the category Editor in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog in the picture again .
if you enter a string in the Label or Description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you would like , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , i.e. , 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here is illustrated by pictures on which Jesus , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try similar features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . afterwards , some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name implies , this bar shows you date stat@@ s about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ esc@@ ales . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create via the HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . please note that all images are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically entered .
at the bottom of the page , you can set up various resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images download , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . it can therefore browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy it to it . so , the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are in a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , you will need to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others to your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures itself are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be distributed as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it scans the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , then the pictures of the URL you have given when you create the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file by HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for exporting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the Manual copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally copied to the .@@ k@@ im file , copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option on this page is limit image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , because the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File import ... select , becomes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders you want to copy the im@@ porting images .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import which categories of the file to be imported , and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database . you can see an example for this in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and watch pictures : when you see pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting up the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your pictures . it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically re@@ uses this in future startup . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings possibilities of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as to how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete list of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
see the settings available to you for setting up the list of members . in the list above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its module system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface .
the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; they are , but are sold separately . most of the modules have a help page which you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are shared among each other together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures . the demo database can be accessed either through the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t tell , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications which use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , shows all the pictures that the picture preview currently shows .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , for example , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you would have selected persons to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are not compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and toolbar at the top . under the toolbar , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the picture to show you an overview of all the available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons on the picture where the picture has been recorded , etc . you can set each picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
here you can see three lists with a text field by specifying people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be m@@ apped on all 50 pictures , you can find that the names used are moved upwards , find the persons faster and arrange them .
if you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and have these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the thumb@@ nails and back buttons , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry into a category and put it there to add it to a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can shift the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to get this window shown again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the type of pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all the pictures if you do not have a filter . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be shown in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images , without having to store them on the hard disk . of course you need to save the images somewhere , hence &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that the thumb@@ nails can be previ@@ ewed . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support you to avoid creating the CD so far . so if you want to avoid trouble , such as the m@@ ess of your pictures , please buy a bigger hard drive to save all images .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end ones you want to make for others un@@ available and click Current View in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see , control the menu entry All out of the current view .
this allows you to specify which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images to lock , which eliminates all the images you have locked . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other , anyone who can access the file index@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with that you spend them at some point . for this reason features &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course , he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and place them somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after right @-@ click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ s@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slideshow . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus . the slide will be stopped by pressing C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and out of the picture . with the min@@ us button you can easily pull out a rec@@ tangle with the mouse button . with the minus button you can re @-@ zoom in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed out . with the uni@@ formity @-@ key , the zoom sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are with the plus and minus key .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . you can see this . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever has always selected , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you display categories in the In@@ dre preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database .
in , you can see a picture on which was painted . to switch to the coloring mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture from the context menu . to exit the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not entirely rule , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the right position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click on App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each item has a feasibility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their degree of visibility is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar .
the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you want . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the player to the top or bottom of a view . then a rec@@ tangle will display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the player to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on one another , drag the player in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window ordering are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the button on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the top left in the fas@@ cia bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the fas@@ cia bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere .
you can save the current window view with view window layout ... to save it . a dialog is displayed in which you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 is current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering on the toolbar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full picture in the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View menu , select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or steps effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super sampling uses the neighbouring pixels with it . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always further divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a particular number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn Y@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays do not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finishes , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you don &apos;t support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object reception of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this property gives a better approach for projections but requires more time to render .
if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the bottom , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is displayed in a board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window instructions , you will explain how you can create and save window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation field Def@@ ault Window System : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window ordering when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Del@@ ete button .
each window layout is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ ver@@ end anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without closer knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have everything installed correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name Camera . when you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the camera &apos;s basic settings , this is subject to later guidance , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the Application button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a Qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite final level . if you ren@@ ame the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the item to the bottom when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise one unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something more simple .
in both cases , a dialog box where you can select how to add the object . please select first object . you can then change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the preview see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but take the simplest one .
if you do not see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then press the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ ame your image with one click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
in the Color List you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . select the color list in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the box color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ och@@ rome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be done just as you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the App@@ ly button ) so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the floor around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the next step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then choose Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finishing properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if met@@ alli@@ c : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected when you have used editing return .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change default short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar . you can add and remove commands with this option Tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can click with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can adjust whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images are to always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Set@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of it , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , load &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; when closing the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; so set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image editing with some powerful Base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry report with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled in , and you can just follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto ; then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto ; and hopefully soon answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language .
the best way to take part in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; attempts to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to access the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; in order to access these settings , you have to select the show@@ foto in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should show a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes it easy to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make any more than scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images immediately in a given folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom in and out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ ly ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option before saving will have to be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the option Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image automatically to save and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is automatically counted when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button opens the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob About starts the K@@ DE button for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting up Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... select the short@@ cut in the player window and specify short@@ cuts ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short@@ com@@ ings . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
beginning require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; every K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure Speci@@ fies the script to display the setup dialog . to store and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change Sign@@ als that a new piece is p@@ opped up . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume Sign@@ als a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Provi@@ des the path to the selected files in the playlist , if a custom menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to add one &apos;s entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove the entry .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do clean @-@ up operations . for example , this includes saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly detect the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a quite certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you may already have a number of play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on specific criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right way to re @-@ experience your music !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you need to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile time point using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
enable de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; help , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use voice bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ able compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ able . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save mood files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ able . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ able / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
to save play@@ lists while moving , the current playlist saves automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist by ending .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keeping up @-@ to @-@ date pieces in part change causes the playlist window to open / un@@ roll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window pane .
changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting O@@ wn fonts , the otherwise grey displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , Player Window and Con@@ text Browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection activated for foreground and background color .
continue playing at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start the playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the input field display text introduces the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering the plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen in a multi @-@ way monitor environment should appear the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable even more settings in this card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that is to browse &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search will also be performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l configuration section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . on Calcul@@ ator : will the machine be entered on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the Kart@@ ei@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your load .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers can be viewed to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimum .
some features such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
most likely one of your files will cause an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can locate the file by clicking ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when processing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : m@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; without $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ inst@@ ated with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Re@@ play / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . you can sometimes click on a symbol in the Control Center under Ap@@ pear@@ ance symbols . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ mat@@ or Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
most installation problems are solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error if you are interested in fixing an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come into it now ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select Show columns . you can also use the Sh@@ ort@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and drop it there exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the playlist button . click on it .
you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be Which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default no MP3 decoder are included ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( eg S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you to find the cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fying sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less wear@@ er react to the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . perform all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a full list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run it with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened from the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running unit : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP address and your username with your username . this assumes your identification exists in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button represents a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returns .
OK , the Player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the Control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this is adjusting the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column cap@@ tion in the playlist window . then , you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select the rating or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to match the short @-@ term Amar@@ ok plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing animations in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click on New design ....

audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and thus also a lot of bug reports .
probably got &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have and Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not appearing . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that the development files are installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ compile and install .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also has to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type = sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable m@@ map to support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts is not taken care of . you can naturally take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so @-@ needed supervis@@ or for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this Quick Start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection facilitates you to search for specific pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button you save . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is contained in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , then you &apos;ll find these play@@ lists in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . just drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play button .
the audio CD function uses the audio cd protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have various options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers lots of different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the runtime menu . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also found under the scroll menu . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or adjust the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and change to the next or last piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the fullness of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser shows different information regarding the current part . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may have noticed that the Start window will drop off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats can have any name , but images with the word front in the name are preferred preferred . the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , recommended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running track . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub @-@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . for this , no running text script is needed .
the search button searches a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - grouped only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are om@@ itted .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - album - sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and then sorted by performer .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a drop @-@ down menu with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options .
load - This le@@ aks the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry gives you the same effect .
set pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) move files into the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , and it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
set up a compilation mark - Chan@@ ges a record marked album back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated artist .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser includes the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Intelligent play@@ lists are also possible . click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with a lot of files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter key , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ ending of the Shift key can be difficult . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : as a result , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters there , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contains , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations at will . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include a comment .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key and then right @-@ click in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , follow the undo and restore buttons . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you see in the player window via the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking with the mouse double in the respective display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the Status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can consider all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( details of setting up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the start point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated using the same menu entry .
the New Fil@@ l button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist Edit opens the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens for editing the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed in line with the player setting .
played songs - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ scripts , by clicking on script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Write section section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins will be used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you must have a exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you would like to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that you will receive a poor quality while re@@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you must have a exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original into the image file is completed , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD &apos;s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; hence sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases reached &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : an open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ code WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folders and filen@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project is changed and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non @-@ saved project will be asked what will happen with it , as if you had called file shot .
when you call this entry , you can choose from the appearing dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described via the What is the ? aid ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function will cause &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
open the CD @-@ Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create only one copy of a CD which you can burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows you to create only one copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the Copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burn button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , coding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking of the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a nar@@ rower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment for it below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is designed for person@@ alizing and tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the functional scope , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the included programs will give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ rights ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; read for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these wa@@ v files ( This co@@ er@@ ver packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all of these programs are usually present for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile a bit yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders must be installed that are needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid buying copied audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling to read a &amp; CD is explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually captured .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you &apos;ll find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the set @-@ up menu - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default . it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already expi@@ red file is selected for coding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , to set up the encoder ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be included with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate app . 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car oster@@ e@@ o@@ zers . but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ driven for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; can be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( the author of the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information released on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged . any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address when retri@@ eving data from the server does not use ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . when using fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD ; to save wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done .
to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ ver and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) are on the tab for setting the coding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the co@@ er@@ ver package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the co@@ er@@ ver can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined co@@ er@@ ers . more information about co@@ er@@ ers is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ er@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood all , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write bre@@ aches on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD .
here we determine the co@@ dec to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . because we are la@@ zy , let us share the program to use fre@@ ed@@ b to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the files from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change if the matching settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
just select for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is easier , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately begins reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries that are resulting from it . the directory or filen@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ qu@@ ordin@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : ap@@ ologies , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? read and add parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know it , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; e@@ ject after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another disk . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files .
everything just as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be smooth@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music clever@@ ly , you will never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on hard disk , was described in the previous section and setup . first , a connection to the Internet is built , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b collected data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already filled in and the name of the artist and album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the comment field below can be used for each piece of comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you don &apos;t just start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with upper case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ ver in order to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not provide the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and album are shown above the piece list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or out . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what exp@@ ires .
click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message appears when you try to work with a co@@ er@@ ver you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . thus , read and encoding parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and encoding ( though , of course , two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the desktop Multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions include a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations on settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; may it do . at least after contacting with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and you agree with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; get SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time display of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the used method .
session support . if you quit &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and so change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set up the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the Settings menu the entries text events and events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section is how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu item under the Organ@@ ize ... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the files in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialogue appears , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is added automatically to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ determined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map will translate General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all occur@@ ren@@ ces of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events in the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices etc . ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section which may appear as many times as desired . but a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how the patches from General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so do not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound is a different percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to form notes on the percussion channel . see for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channels , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , trying to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it will be converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) formula and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM plans that a keyboard that gets a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a ton higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the View channel view : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to produce very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed , etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ mid work@@ space on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window ;
if you just want to quickly listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automatic Ad@@ ding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , the program inspir@@ es me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a little time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files collect , make music and prove pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or , if you simply want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and no one gets money for it . I want to emphasize that I can only further program because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - fixing the error that the pitch of EE@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ eker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or just a supporting e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries played after each other , you should use the category persistent playlist .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the play@@ lists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select a different category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically stopped by opening another source . however , this would interfere with the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special video embed embed video in the playlist XML .
that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages must be the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments by K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is started in a console application and searches for error messages regarding the load of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end is always taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be stolen , the device to use and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
because the V@@ DR support of S@@ MB only supports X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , KM@@ Player uses various names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
are there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as a user root after installing the device . it is essential to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom can be seen on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

G@@ opher has initially started as a distributed campus information system from the University of Minn@@ es@@ ota . it allows the user to access information that is located on G@@ opher servers on the Internet .
G@@ opher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a bookmark ( Book@@ mark ) . thus , the user can access the information directly with the help of the bookmark without need@@ ing to browse the entire menu . g@@ opher menus are not standardized in so far as that each G@@ opher server provides specific information .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems are probably used for the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made about the box ; website .
if you have questions about and / or comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual can be drawn to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct pron@@ ounc@@ ement : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to operate , can also use a la@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good overview about &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do it . to control &amp; latex ; good books , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other mark@@ up languages includes &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be re @-@ closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Intro@@ duction Wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; . the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document .
document classes : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used increasingly ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ ons for &amp; latex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Scripture ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed .
when setting a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le , the command generates an empty line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective button .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding row in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print from DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the box search , the elements of the DVI ; file were cli@@ cked with the editor and once cli@@ cked to an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked to the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer jump@@ ed .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . a master document simpli@@ fies the work with other .@@ tex files . a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings when using a project .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is wa@@ sted and no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece is done ; after quick construction .
when looking at the Edit Tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for fast incorpor@@ ation of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , marks or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( select a selection field possible ) .
when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © es is used for defining the font size . it can be used to set the font for the main text , the marks , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the above source sample has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the push of a button .
the source text must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the log file . if it is not the case , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows to change the font size inside the environment .
changes are only considered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many options to obtain the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be recur@@ sively represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background is presented to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language , now follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . for this , a quote , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are necessary as required for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code was created , the conversion can start into sw@@ apped other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . to this end , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le needs to be set up ... Tools Building out .
to search for the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on to the default search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the appropriate &amp; latex ; -@@ Document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( setting up the settings ... Editor )
should not open when using Rap@@ ture of the &amp; DVI ; viewers can &apos;t open , an error can be found . if an error is present , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file er@@ ases the source code error source . in the editor , the exec@@ utable La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the error line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; box ; jumps to the wrong line .
once you click on the button on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
common users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file can be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by publishing an existing document and selecting file template from document ... Create .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into a document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry for the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below can be performed .
&amp; box ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be accessed over the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in &amp; latex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click on the right C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way you can select the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drag@@ ging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when the arrow keys are used , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the different types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ Respon@@ ses Edit jump marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark .
the Edit is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code is always added &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command is also available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a return value ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove are the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to the Edit It@@ ems section .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore provides &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a more possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command you jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the surrounding area .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { surrounding } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command is close to the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit surroundings .
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
with this command you jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ving bracket .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ly stap@@ le of a &amp; tex ; group # , is spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted group cl@@ amps quickly the overview can be lost . this command complete the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple application characters are used as a number . for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple quotes . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two close @-@ to @-@ date quotes for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used in any language specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French requirements . many other languages are also available .
for Shift ; Enter key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , complete &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set ... La@@ Te@@ X will be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby arrange all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to add this to the next tab . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the associated , &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate spaces for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) , three are built for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Ki@@ le ... can be completed .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surrounding } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and the full list is possible . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be added , so that a jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit Fol@@ der N@@ est jump token and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; can make settings to these lists . there can be different W@@ alls for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language use .
the command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . it must always have a few letters entered with \ \ begin and the execution mode will have a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of the environment .
when calling the full edit mode , the surrounding area or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key is automatically captured by the command to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin . after that , the surrounding execution can be continued in the simplest way , and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as the box detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... boxes ; can be done by default settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of shut@@ ters that are immediately replaced by l@@ ump@@ y strings . lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be fully furnished . as an example of a check list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word is filled with full @-@ time editing or key C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large owners are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noticed that many W@@ Ã ¤ ns are written in a document more than once . thus offers &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be fully de@@ fied . here , the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified .
the full @-@ time files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode of the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home Fol@@ der . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialog with graphics allows the creation of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are compiled in groups , creating comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by keyboard Alt ; 2 . after that the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and be viewed using the old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Fast Construction command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no displayed viewer should be used , each time a new window is opened .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... Find the following information for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path needs to be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; latex ; is a well @-@ developed system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a full manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we lift it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer reli@@ ed on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked and done the symbol for the XML processor !
this application is expected to include a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the popular folder , leave the current job folder . if not , then remove the selection of current job folders and specify the desired folder in the folder of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time you started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the straight opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , you can simply select the current job folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , its file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be insp@@ ected is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file simply be checked . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be verified using another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed verification selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; using definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is required in file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone else is used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start working with the Plugins menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles within the project , such as team leader and sub @-@ project manager .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as expresses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) will appear bold after they are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and notes . see for further information about notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters a file into the CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
there can be either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the set nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ esis and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible through the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be dealt with one another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / low @-@ case letters of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted in such a way as described in the tag@@ XML files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ump@@ y caps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
automatically update start and end tag : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent notes : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using button default , the default values can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default settings to the default on the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / off of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning noti@@ fications range is used to control the display of warnings from non @-@ poll@@ s by means of hooks .
the location around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the Par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree using the mouse buttons .
in the field of Struc@@ ture Tree Settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty groups are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
the section for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will be un@@ folded while editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are grouped in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in the read @-@ only mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed , with time numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger so that the normal case does not need to be respected .
the counterpart to de@@ bug@@ ging session Start the session . includes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initi@@ alize a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if a request is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is set .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folder contains two file types , the text and instructions are inserted faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
gives the source texts used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag grouped together by the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
returns a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
whit@@ esp@@ ace does not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; to be replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ day .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = returns ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor to access via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New action to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User Language button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detector settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ sq@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ sq@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way the script tries to find : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only an instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input can be input by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field , you can specify what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output output ; error messages , to the default output output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available , so that an input while using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphic Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered to be loos@@ ely , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is indicated that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ day in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it is still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to find an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = their description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation for example :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the cart@@ on ( except through reason ) , but try it out .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of doc@@ r@@ c file that serves to form context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ scripts should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email sending , tool@@ box toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . the posts are reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication . to make a new contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when up@@ loading you are asked for their private g@@ pg key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can search for . in the New resource dialog the input fields have to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the DT@@ D DT@@ D ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bars , and start the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in the event of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages that are not currently supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and convert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that only this user can use them personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; samples to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ beds the common use of special tools and patterns within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a number of main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest to and for further information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ cards , rel@@ o@@ ad , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click on the editor pane will lead to a further context menu on how basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor . currently it takes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of toolbar buttons is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the Bau@@ man@@ visions ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it and wander through . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator to manage the files in the project by right @-@ clicking . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or deletion of the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; All possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used . the category hangs by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed by adding a folder doc to a project .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window , which can be reached via useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts executed , give all error messages ( so it is ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can save it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer in pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the aforementioned claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more details are available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; write so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are displayed !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
on and off the problem re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , it will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
load a project tool@@ bars . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by means of Settings ... Settings . toolbar buttons are saved by means of toolbar buttons , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
remove a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of toolbar buttons to the main server , where anyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar ref@@ uses when this day is contradic@@ ted by the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will de@@ activate it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with the selection of an entry , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
specifies the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; for details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can be added and the sequences can be changed .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out from top to bottom , as for example after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled in .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ example ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be hoo@@ ked up . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the check@@ box , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profile or using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filen@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by checking its own tree view for each profile .
in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot currently be influenced .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the icon Open Project from the toolbar . the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before publishing , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project structure gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave similarly , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program window . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project toolbar or the Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above are toolbar bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best st@@ age@@ able via the toolbar . use and addition differenti@@ ate . adding toolbar buttons is treated below in the section Add tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be removed , tool@@ bars ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries action will be removed and action edited which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and specify the settings .. set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itzel and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are written in corresponding sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree using global templates . see for more information on the template Tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area always in the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
design a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template Save As local template save ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and dropping onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag@@ ging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project file tree view , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is backed up , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can specify head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically using &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things in the use of templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behaviour of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog will appear :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded once the parent attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like plain text . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows a pre@@ ordered or re@@ arranged text for templates in this folder . this could be common head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and turn back if necessary to the source code editor , in which the executed changes in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ iness of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor in syn@@ ch@@ ron . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is active , the keyboard press moves the active cursor from one window to the other , where the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be set via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatic . in principle , the recommendation can be set between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatic . basically , the recommendation applies : a small breakdown for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , tools document properties can be selected . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the content , such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves independently . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or a distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that the insert of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted , enclosed with text , any other adjacent anchor tag must be removed .
some toolbar buttons , such as the tables assistant or the list assistant , are disabled . later , they will work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists will need to be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for studying style sheets . unlike other style templates , searching for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need besides &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the complete path from a filen@@ ame without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded sty@@ list file names with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g work folder . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete compliance with a template called QNAP or a given model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each process .

on systems with the installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll up / down with the arrow keys through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass combined expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
filen@@ ame : a valid local filen@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are also allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time correc@@ ting a lot in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any amount of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ isons and merging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
3 @-@ way merging is also fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the merging editor under the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anger if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in a line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ from files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o destination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ inations Fol@@ der
opening dialog allows you to manually set file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
through the folder folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and / or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but a folder is used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the compar@@ isons / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you don &apos;t need to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also drag and drop you : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Each info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while over the line . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the abstra@@ ction column from the text will be interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line will be shown on broken lines .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ modified &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is selected in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also cause a jump of the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes by automatic merge or by manual editing , no further line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the Qu@@ el ; displayed . this is just a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the Text &amp; lt ; Con@@ text Con@@ text ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the options are ignored when selecting the sources or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the left , right , up , down , side on , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . by inser@@ ting button you can switch between plug @-@ in and over @-@ write mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merging and edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image forward / C@@ trl @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or the next / previous conflict . therefore , conflicts must be differentiated between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . however , be careful with this option , because you may over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board acci@@ dentally .
line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use chari@@ ot return + line boost \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line @-@ ends of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored at the next start . ( Set up menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the selected script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ro@@ uted . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically set an odd color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ l@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line delay &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ line character , although they are different . if this option is enabled , auto @-@ return signs will be made visible , but like a white sign . while merging this option , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still shown , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is going .
automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Features Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for the comparison and merging .
if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the Control Center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding appears a short note about what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , you may only see the differences between two of three files . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; -@@ gt ; C will display a second over@@ look column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then un@@ expect@@ edly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the filen@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . if a normal command line command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users don &apos;t want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command line command line to convert the entry into upper case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern $ keyword $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another line @-@ off command . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so practically er@@ ased .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / Re@@ p / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and merging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ down algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without really carrying out ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all the folders .
if you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of the problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when all contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . for folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option to synchron@@ ize directories is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merging ( unsure ) is checked &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
while merging is done one file after the other . it status column indicates if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resol@@ uted conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , C will be used as a target in the Three @-@ folder Mer@@ ge mode , B will be used as a target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you first want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exec@@ utes certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
once you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue to work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , allow &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again later . even if the merge action has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not need to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ emental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ emental @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ ing files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the major advantage is that this folder can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default setting .
when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not included for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an end loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled by default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ ges@@ et date and file size . this speed advantage , however , will cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to the date of change . no real comparison occurs . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the date of modification . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
enable synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the results are selected to merge so that both folders are identical . the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled by default .
if there are differences , copying of the newer file is proposed as action instead of merging the newer file as action . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled by default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just merging whole folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally , the folder merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
you probably prefer to compare a file directly by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu . you can also merge a single file directly from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or modi@@ fying date . therefore , the permissions or the change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first with the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ ic@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally needed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part performed , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) already . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for quite a long time and learned a lot while looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is is the case the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !

only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
there are only entries showing differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will fail after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled by default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . far@@ ew@@ ells in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works within a desktop as well as on several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button allows windows to be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other des@@ kt@@ ops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and Finish . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maximize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other work@@ tops .
if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown .
cross this field indicates the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ el Fig@@ ures , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ;
if this field is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the layout of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , like from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers appear ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its contents and move it . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . If you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you will need to enter the key win@@ dow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign a value to it . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen resolution . you can use &amp; K@@ mag to enlarge a portion of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the cl@@ amped or the exact viewing of a photo . this application includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fier window .. The image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you may choose &amp; K@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( select window mode ) or the surrounding of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the cursor to the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; press Shift or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short instructions for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button Document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen motion . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use a magni@@ fier to use a magni@@ fier in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / K@@ mag ( enter either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides for a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also cause pain caused by the mere moving of your mouse . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoiding pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be om@@ itted for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
if the smart move is activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , exec@@ uting a mouse click .
if intell@@ ect is switched on , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after sh@@ utting down the mouse button wait before it releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .t@@ xt , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears to be delayed , you can shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider bar sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings on the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of App@@ ly .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be switched off at first . if you then have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral component of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the side of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an im@@ position . if you use the intelligent shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will return the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continuing to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I do not manage to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to highlight text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some suggestions for this :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away . so you know exactly when when the smart move starts moving the shift time . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; should be installed on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ins . this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and which the an@@ tigen of the mouse button causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time to start a drag@@ ging process before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the default text pas@@ sage@@ . from the text passages you can choose frequently used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words will be included in the vocabulary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have done properly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the memory memory . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page language version as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
enter the language generator &apos;s input field in the input field . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service will be used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ amm@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications a standardized interface for voice output is available . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by key short@@ cuts or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ box menu or in the tool@@ box for text passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory . the selected text passage is only entered in the input field with the selection of Add to the input field .
with the second drop of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to reject any changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ book is not saved . if you want to check before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ book is to be saved .
the vocabulary page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can select the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the dic@@ tion@@ aries available . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you set a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting in the menu bar , on the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the cross @-@ country memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the course memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar can be moved by default via the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with references to the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text pas@@ sage@@ books with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not have the command for the voice output correctly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the voice output command on the map . ( see settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for more details . )
Festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system from Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and to spread it without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the voice output command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to spread it without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wave file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax happily swal@@ lowed the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the adjustment of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use the possibility to use the t@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can output text by the computer . there is a list of already spoken phrases that the user can spend time again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no synthes@@ izer contains . a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sharing system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech output is done through the speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , etc .
allows the generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configur@@ ing and setting kt@@ ops about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher and adjust properly .
for the first start of kt@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the cardboard card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map map is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; because the program speed @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; card@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man in kt@@ mu@@ g , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear at the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a spokes@@ man from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a spokes@@ man from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a j@@ unk and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost always use . go back to the card tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map card orders to create and manage text jobs . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language distribution system . click the tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card orders will be displayed , and you can create text jobs and read . see . remove the mark , C@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the control bar when read , it disappears as soon as the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD click on the General tab and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read , and select the text in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ stressed lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that should be read , and select the text editor from the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; in other applications is embedded as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you of the events you have set up . you can read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech @-@ dispens@@ er &apos;s program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to avoid mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
News have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that lets you read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each job you receive from the card card is a text assignment . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one that reads , this output is stopped and ended .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be more types of filters .
string replac@@ ers replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that enable the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters , you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice for example on the cardboard card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter .
if a text assignment , message , warning or &amp; node is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts , it is edited by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the set normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not checked and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and you will see the following setup di@@ alogs .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for setting fonts . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed from top to bottom in the order displayed .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
these buttons lets you load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you need to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied .
the string translation filter is applied to the text only if all conditions correspond to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if the filter is in agreement . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( whit@@ esp@@ ace ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the cardboard card speaker , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text attached to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board spokes@@ man . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the microphone you want . if the text is filled with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which best matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply to an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to the K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the node ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program t@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text to the pre @-@ reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , please
open two &amp; console ; -@@ Windows . start kt@@ ops in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; reform@@ ers filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you need to do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , they may be remedi@@ ed by a string translation filter .

to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; get out of the source code archive for k@@ de@@ fam@@ ation or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check if speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ ter works correctly with your voice synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sets . the user can withdraw pro@@ positions or paragraph styles , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it is used , otherwise the best matching speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you can see in .
when you click Add Spe@@ aker to Add , and to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the map card speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the module will be shown below for the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter festival .
select the code trans@@ coding for text to be passed to the festival . in the case of voices , the t@@ ts are known , this setting is automatically done . generally , western languages such as ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 apply , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider controls , you set volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display this grey , the voice you selected do not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of the K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set is quickly synthes@@ ized .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click on App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control .
here are all orders in the queue listed , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently edited sentence . the spokes@@ man ID corresponds to the column ID on the cardboard card speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or withdraw from the list below , which is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several movements ) .
by clicking on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card .
here only text orders are listed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaker speed here . 50 % ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ; % about the double normal speaker speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen readers has been read , the retained orders will be res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that talks messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who is entering the room .
a text assignment is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds and kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card pass only apply to normal text jobs . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ No@@ tify messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .
tick this check box to turn the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played is made by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is stated in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the noti@@ fications to be submitted as follows :
use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications for a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All No@@ tification will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voice , voice speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival uses the edition of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . this can begin faster with reading , since only the first movement needs to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter is automatically set up as an input . you can change its settings or add other set limits filters , but beginners will get away from it .
on the easiest way , you will learn how to set up the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection . turn on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection and select text to read . switch on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection menu , change some properties and check how the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection changes . for this , you must have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then can start faster with reading , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then stop or cancel orders on the map card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation filter filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing .
character Rec@@ ogni@@ tion Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( cri@@ es ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation filter from mistake , you can insert it back by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
the Spe@@ aker card cho@@ oser can be used to over@@ write the application settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card board spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of an equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the Spe@@ aker &apos;s settings , choose this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokesperson , which is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box when the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several marks .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the Spe@@ aker area , the most likely to delete the following , click on the Def@@ ault icon and then use Spo@@ kes@@ man closest to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . with G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x the command is registry @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try updating or un@@ installing G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , Fri@@ ars &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / t@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int .
on the card board audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the map card . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the voice speed settings are ignored if &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is changed into SS@@ ML . ) Please enable either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ formed filter , and set up the microphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . therefore , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber creates the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added a special character set filter and now I can go back in &amp; t@@ ts ; no longer set up or go back . on the track record orders will appear , the job will consist only from a set . what do I do wrong ?
you may not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for punc@@ tual recognition .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by running G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts in the audio output related to AL@@ SA . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; freezes when you stop a text job and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the talk speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
if you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least just created on request .
the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian Gui@@ delines ) . the configure option column shows the configure parameter which causes over@@ flow of creation .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

CD dec@@ as@@ echo t@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first whether your voice synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . therefore , look for festivals to be the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding on ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 must be set .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language distribution system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package that you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of bug fixes is not required , you only need to re @-@ compile the festival ) . then insert the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

the command smo@@ du@@ l allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice synthes@@ izer that can be controlled in a command line .
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; that allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be fully installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up with installing and setup . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and release level . by marking the non @-@ return requests the definition can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will automatically pres@@ et this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to be edited in the Device Configuration dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system startup , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the option manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the Device List .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need . switching on an out@@ dated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need . switching off an enabled network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if more than one network interface is available on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution of the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ds or Her@@ b buttons in the top priority .
by clicking the Add ... button from the group Computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group Computer to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog will be displayed .
the list named specifies machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list contains especially known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button . if the well known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog known calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; variable configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description concentr@@ ates on the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , am &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point that as@@ signs a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1.@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is needed for the IP forwarding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually the address is 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which operates as a closed circle .
in this part are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; dat ; console the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the band does not record the band , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat ; the pr@@ une , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by un@@ folding the entry .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; K ; by changing the symbol for the tape , it shows that the integration for the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you to@@ g@@ gle the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens up for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the working folder for review .
when you have confirmed the check @-@ in settings , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the throughput and time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
when you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rec@@ over will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput and time remaining .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index@@ .@@ This process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re @-@ create the index in two ways from the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... make the settings in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path needs to refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape will be dis@@ connected ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for floppy em@@ bank@@ ers .
is the option enabled , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ dly block size for tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be handled directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar - even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows users to quickly access information about issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; so try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides , with the help of which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filters and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log tries to open the system log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not start you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter to a selected filter . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if the string containing the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as Protocol lines of level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server .
in addition , you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new log lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol for the display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you will find further information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion @-@ Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is quickly becoming standard for the control of the program starts when bo@@ oting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re @-@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when bo@@ oting the system or changing to a different runtime . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services , on the other hand , do not include set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something at high speed , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one that he finds .
the standard runtime is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following in the initial area :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have completed something , then you can repair it by re@@ boot the system and execute the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server runtime that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . furthermore , I could still have a user runtime , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runtime levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ levels or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . the entry will be removed from its initial runtime ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to only copy them to a new run level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to enable the different work areas ( Available System Services , Run@@ Level 1 Start , Run@@ Level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ levels , and now the machine is continually rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ating without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , can be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made any changes , you need to save it . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . for editing , select the desired user or the group you want with double @-@ click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . further card cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card card password management appears when Shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the limitations of the space are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space restriction .
the card card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work in the same way .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
