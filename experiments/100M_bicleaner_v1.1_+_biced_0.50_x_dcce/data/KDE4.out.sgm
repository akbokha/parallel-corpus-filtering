<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mechanical translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish in the best case produce a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; in spite of its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings Add-ons.... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default setting modules from the kde; addons package. please note that if you have additional software installed on your system, you may have more modules installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & conqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in the & konqueror; on Extras Figures. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The view filter module (also called Ordnerfilter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; is to show nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, you can easily detect large files, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color coding and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the easy detection of the shading depth or the image of another file name, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it will be displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby representation errors may occur due to restrictions in the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target will not always be complied with. it will draw frames to prevent the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of an area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation remains. here it is always advantageous for the label and to avoid space losses by frame, that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View Ankeeping on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Image Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras photo gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy to use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use it to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as the camera or lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitization; try to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.... This will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to answer you questions to other users of & digikam, and hopefully soon answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digitization; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitization; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and database. simply enter the name of the path or click the Folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your machine. here the data collection is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digikam; will also be used as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & digikam; look at any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. while browsing the folder, you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam, recursively search the library path in its full depth. you can not exclude subfolders unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by adding a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digitization; possibly also around it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu aid.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderOptions and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk device. the camera can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support, so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not have to look for thumbnails or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier & digitized; by writing a small module to supplement a function than the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. for example, filtering on the filename will only work when it displays a symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the Albensettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos, which are stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. choose album Import images to it. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and album features allowing you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a method to highlight your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by collection from the toolbar or view albums Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elders, Average, New Year: these put the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do so, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click on the image with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. to the collection are always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you must wait for a short while, while the thumbnails will be generated. this can be avoided by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each picture is displayed below the preview. what information is this, you can change the digitization; set it up. select the albums page and adjust the preview image to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment on a picture. the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all for & digitized. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can view all the features that are with & digikam; you have the choice between viewing the pictures, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the file type submenu. to do so, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing by other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur. some programs do not save this data when you save the changed image. this will result in the loss of this information from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for turning. the simplest one is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the preview button and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo from & digikam; delete it, it will be moved to the trash bin; F8 Picture Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslipquot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My punctuation quot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords in loss of the database are re-imported as soon as & digitized; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword quot; or to an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have a new keyword, this keyword will be used for the substituting of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the key word in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My stitch.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My stitch. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumbnail preview and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be shown in the main window under the thumbnail of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the photos context menu with the right mouse button. the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower right of the select frame, which displays the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click on it the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters what you have entered as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select a search, the search form will appear to enter the search information previously entered. if you select Advanced Search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows images to be compared by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a swellbook, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the unused search in the left side bar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-made colour sketches: draw a quick sketch and / or digitization; find the appropriate images. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl, left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window opens. if you are back in & digitized; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or Ships operations on one of the images, then you will be able to compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you use pairs of pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it on the left. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table such as F4 File Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window are available in the light table for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you recognize on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click on it and hold the & LMB; in the preview then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works exactly as in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the picture. this is done in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we look at the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, edit, edit, edit, edit, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, assembled and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need no longer to find a particular photo. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will definitely not use & digikam;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats freely.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you do something in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to store metadata in the site of the metadata in & digikam; enable it to enable EXIF- and IPTC data to be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so & digikam, provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos at work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or add the images to the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are removed from & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are characteristics of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos easily, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming, associations, memories, the historic period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help Him about the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. if you export your images in web galleries, then these captions are exported according to your wishes in the label and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now moves with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are countless and will continue to be deeper in the future. I'm sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic data. & digikam; can also export kml files which you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">"" "the following description tells you what information in the setup page of" "" "& digikam" "" "should be stored as information:" ""</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support neither commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the working description of the photographer. examples of this can be title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author's field, this must also be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the image is a stock picture, then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify them in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digitized; a module for batch processing will be available in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate errors, plate failures, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. this kind of losses are the same as you can also pass on traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics, which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which claims a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you are using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you are just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protective aging, they are caused by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from corrupted disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good record device on high-quality media in a non-expropriate format. also, read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected environment. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's tools include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives available: disk failure study</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower tempera, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of electrical current, it differs from devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection then you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also watch out that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to even continue to work until the current expires. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup the web solutions are very secure. transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard on a GPL incompatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% in workstation systems. in case of notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, e.g. thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has not been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: untrue, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, TAFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer distant from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result more deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make no one responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. back up your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strike you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget an aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster preparedness means always a non-local storage. bring up your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for data loss in spite of backing up panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that are to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two times: the total backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made. this backup comes next to an versioning system, except that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between the files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original hold, memory, scalability, media, resize images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 years that is about the period of time you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to be a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printer for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let us assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the file if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if there is no software available that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can save a lot more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that it is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data in a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP also fits because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera image, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you are editing the images again with & digitization; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section Adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and switch it. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera appear. some cameras do not provide thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are shown on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, Manufacturers, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods from & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected button. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these pictures have not been downloaded by now. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the buttons All download or download selected, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed, as normal folder is sorted, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by erasing the Delete All button. if you want to delete only a few, you need to select them first and use the delete selected afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a & digikam; album are downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera completely, you should do this via the camera system because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use a particularly meaningful name for the photos. the filenames are usually re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you load photos from different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is automatically created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two affect the data about the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. turn off the date & time option. for further customization, you should read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo is displayed under the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually enabled, and if your camera does not provide this information, & digikam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom panel of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, you can use it to automatically load sub-albums in the target album. all the pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta Data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case save & digitization; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based subsection at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image chooser is done, & digikam, you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in long- and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography it can be interesting to associate a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses an airplane to cartographically an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitized; user want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to add the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data go into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, semitrailers and map references. the question is actually more about how the data entered into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and finally via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data from images and from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the characters of hairy coordinates that are created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over his work processes as possible. there are many settings that the behaviour of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you have to select in the Settings menu; you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you will set the default behavior of & digikam; be sure to click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this can be descriptions such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the image is a stock picture, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently in the image and not only in the database of & digikam;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digikam; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image descriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images store: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitization; to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digitized; album folder that will not have any of these extensions, by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & quot; can be set to the default values on this page. each time you open the light table these settings are not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use on fast machines. if you have one then you can get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the image. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect image quality because the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of detail. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images gain more details in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your pictures that are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to view the pointed lights. use the setting through white in the settings. the setting colors will generate some unusual results, as it shows the pointed lights in various rosatars. finally, you can try some parts of the missing information from the pointed lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast saturating like green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructive option, you get the option to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adjusted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image editing. to keep the time for the demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Dcraw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenus Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for gradient correction as you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like the color information from a color space in the other to translate is thus the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior issues when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Click here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digikam, then examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-administrated not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma is not fixed for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile to emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. this could be done manually instead of getting on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obviously what colour profile is intended for. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digicame; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these are loaded by & digikam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you can also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Setting short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, where you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the Camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the ülleimer, you can set the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the deleting a photos and deleting an album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & digikam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also add & digitise the display of the greeting screen; under certain circumstances, this accelerates the starting process from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">Setting Beim Start after new photos is forcing & digitization; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digikam, you will see if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing includes a set of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and underneath the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the Restore button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit back or Restore, by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should get the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl + -Z for the return and Ctrl; -Shift-Z for recovering.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; on the Return or Restore button on the toolbar a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you will see the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar will be displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the Settings dialog from & digikam; see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole phrases. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the menu album. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a side bar at the right edge, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the caption view you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or just change to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the Apply button, there is a button Learn More. however, you can also read the metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also edit the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digitization; -session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, these are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed in the tree by marking the appropriate check boxes. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to have a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search view is used. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view. if the keyword exists already, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is on no keywords which the amount is reduced to three images. you were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it would have to be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come with predictable deviations from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web that correspond to your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work.In addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are via email or web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to alligate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. so, when you work in RGB mode, you need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a fitting monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, compare, Automatically balance and contrast from the correction menu Automatic correction attempt automatically to make the best of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the leukstrengthened values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Like this: this method adjusts the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces garbage. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Add contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitised; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-balance correction is somewhat limited because it is working over a colour space with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry color white balance of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right, a histogram shows that when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow readjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"" "the" "" "Save as and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you set can save you to a text file and download it later." ""</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings return all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the gradation tool that you will find under Colours Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar heating effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar ionization, also called Sabatier, was an effect when one replaced a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar heating effect. the original image is the (1) and that works the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the sliders repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not unusual that you want to change the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be previewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool has a tone correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog with this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the intended purpose.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into which can be moved in order to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the control and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamic, updated based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often the most useful. in this case the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, remedies and solutes. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified which is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most useful. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curtail to the right, e.g. the light notes, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and darker the associated image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons you can make exactly this. any curve that you created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview, and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digitised; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance the image will retain the overall brightness even if you also change the color components. this is especially convenient if you also use the Monochrome option, because the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. color space consists of small space files that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green line filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scene and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm and medium tones while adding a bit of coldness into the tattoos. this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) seepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digikam, apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; Add tool box can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the picture surrounds it with a thin line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a bone effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool stencil you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Processing menu apply in image processing can be used to lay stencils over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template from & digikam, please send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional sharpening tool. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. actually it is not a bit, it works rather psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. elements smaller than the resolution are therefore framed to a common color. this in turn leads to sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colour points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more cremating than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images, a camera has often been used internally. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field of depth while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening work suit. you can use the menu entry Corrigier Depth.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should carefully deal with this, since the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique is refocusing the tool. you can refocus on the menu entry Correction. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is much simpler than it to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correction softness and experiment with something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove mucous from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, one can define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpening and therefore avoided flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitised; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted decoding filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filexplanation. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus achieved mostly better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circuit-shaped folding works much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixles, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauss's folding is very strongly influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values are close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 very rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is Gauss. this is most often caused by a previously executed blurring filter. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more refocused parameters you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you otherwise change the picture. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but will later leave uncomfortable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading and compressed images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the inability to masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original non-sharp paint image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing regulates the blurring of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogenous regions smoothing and detailing details. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is subsequently necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD space a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulb effect, it must be placed higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed through. usually, it is enough for 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never taller than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more of the quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">"" "the" "" "Save as and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with little artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the trip. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitised; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular hiss that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window will remain in the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller flaws cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focus level. this value sets the pixel spacing to the front to detect light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the filter's frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance levels of the darker areas, which are typically more obscured, to increase.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear slippery, when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the parameters for noise reduction you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften with the menu entry Correction softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film granulation, scratches, compressionartefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The save as and loading buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with uniform noise is being restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is visible under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and see the filter results. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Dursection: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermode. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic graphs (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the iris filter, which may possibly increase the necessary shutter speed, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and the color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalence transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the netting correction filter and with three more exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of illumination loss at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with an aperture of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the grading correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator only provides you with positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correction of vignetting on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar concentric effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth density corrects the remote corners to that of the second grader. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second count. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion of the fourth degree. this value works more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameter has the inverse sign of the general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resscales the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction should be performed before any changes in size or size. best perform this correction as the first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a rectal correction, the effect appears to be the false.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them from the editing tool from the image editing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the correction of the correction to a church in Norway. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web site which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set movie grain and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film grain if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter code applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The movie grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">Der & digikam; Filter Oil Painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitised; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam, filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal ze. the lines that define the outline in drawing are stressed. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Der & digikam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam, filter engravure is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monocular landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filtering. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wavelengths 1, the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpening: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial Unsharpening: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Blurring: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photographs, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness blurring: blurred the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Scattering sharpness: blurred the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent sharpness: finds the colour basin in the picture and blurred it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your image. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">As the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter Regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rake filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation.</seg>
<seg id="629">Blowing photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how you can inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformation size change in the menu and enter the target values.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be placed higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The save as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stutter for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and draw a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool for compiling a picture. to trim a photo, simply drag the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the picture will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button the editing button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl + + X). use the Save or Save file entries in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or transverse format. in portrait mode, the greater value of the height and in the transverse format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inch or any other physical size. you can see, for example, a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio cuts the settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The integration aids settings allow you to fade in Help so that you can put together your images better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-organ, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division which is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third organ, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results in the viewer's view along the lines of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to make the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is in the centre of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without guiding the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be made a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your picture focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirrors and vertical mirrors can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the picture preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the transformation function from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the turn. but keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas generated by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is blended a little. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adjusted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformations cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shear your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two shootings are twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformations cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitization; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiling. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats that you know. this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in the image editing pane. you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; accept. in the configuration section you will find further information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even choose the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG on the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section you can find further information about the use of modules with & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading of raw images only with the dcraw program, which is in & digikam; contains more than 200 raw file formats supported. all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam; supported:</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need for photo editing are in & digikam; contain. your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refocus, masking, & etc;. use a uniform type of dialog which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical divide without duplicate. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally divided without duplicate. the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper section shows the original and the lower to the comparison the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">Mouse over '-style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and underexposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview. preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo characteristics: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel. move it while you press the left mouse button. press Ctrl, left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used for editing color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The pallet files that are installed by & kde can apply either to the whole system or just one user. in the latter case, they are located in your personal folder for & kde; -Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Dialogue Palette, you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the range next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color next to it. the color is described below the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select a selection. to create such a selection, click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Beim Cursor is selected under the color button, the color will be inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the mode overwriting mode is selected. this mode can be set by selecting the check box under Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copy, cut and paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line sign, if another color follows. if so, three numerical values are in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dragged with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color selection on the left.</seg>
<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, the & graphviz; contains, are outdated according to the program author & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& cgraphviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphs; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph recounts and in & kgraphs; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; to open or to open the graphs in & kgraphs; in a & kate; -component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these knots)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & knot; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. needs are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate sub-window. initially, when you start & kgraphviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">Once you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is restricted in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file was edited by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the Graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also remember your decision, so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphs; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of a current & kgraphviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & cxviewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but you can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">During program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both save as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut loading page gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or request the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphs; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time will be asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the ability to specify the start behavior of & kgraphs; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or determine to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears in a single click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between various & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -Algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm inserts the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a springspring model layout for ungerized graphene. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold-Heuristics, and includes a multi-wire solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphene.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and meadow, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphene file as parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph according to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; den & graphviz; -Algorithms before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directed or ungerived) and applies the standard algorithm for the specific type (dot; for directed, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides images to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the sane project or any other source such as video streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry Pictures, a dialog box appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducrhe to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window will be displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button, wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen modes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will be able to read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the entire desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the internet. with Flickr it is possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is basically your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Export module is launched to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have all other options set. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, you can start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Familly you can set the permissions on your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed before the upload in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size will change so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie-Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for localisation allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS lane as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization correlator. this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the dialog top to see appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localisation, you must load a track file with a GPX file. this file, of course, contains data that were taken at the same location at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera location must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera system. if the deviation is below, the data is combined. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for pictures, you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality is a location in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlations for interpolating.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog moves the coordinates from a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the shown map. select the region in question and enlarge sie.Add this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the map can be selected manually between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the album preview and the text in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the overall look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. the option For each picture to create a page creates a new page in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail tab allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user as far as the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the generation. the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Image Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zoom or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and mausages. it has been developed for a fast image display and fast access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed as standard in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size rises, as no compression of color information occurs. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Climate is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client is currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The metadata editor's KIPI module currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the KIPI mailing list @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to select the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module also uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image gallery. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first have to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. afterwards, you can create the module via extras MPEG slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. if possible, keep the suffix mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all the settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quickly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages via the Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the Image Processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG, TIFF, or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with craps!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or otherwise continue using it, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file will be stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the output button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the option to automatically overwrite the existing file. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starcode and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can zoom or enlarge the image. for this purpose, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportionally (2 Dim.): change of size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be scanned in advance.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add additional images using the Add button. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Pictures button, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the images you selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Take care not to send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images will be merged into a text file and sent to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifx will be added to the images that are being sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions like you would like to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant passes through OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option filename indicates that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose that the images are displayed in a random order. so it's not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the time distance between the pictures can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. accidentally select a different effect between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse in this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and the next image and stop the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date Adjusts currently no documentation. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop interface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & kphotoalbum; through these, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have given your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images displayed on which both persons are shown. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the pictures of your range.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save his own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view, for example, symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to select which image to be displayed for each individual. to do this, you need to select the image-view window (in more detail) and select the category Editor in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the View window, you can adjust the magnification factor to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog will appear, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog in the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Label or Description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you would like, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total file, i.e., 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here is illustrated by pictures on which Jesus, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try similar features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and watch the Quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. afterwards, some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name implies, this bar shows you date stats about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the timescales. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two options to create HTML pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create via the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphoto album; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. please note that all images are exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically entered.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page, you can set up various resolutions for the images. this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images download, such as a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. it can therefore browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy it to it. so, the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in this, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are in a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., you will need to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others to your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the pictures itself are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be distributed as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it scans the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the images are not found, then the pictures of the URL you have given when you create the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file by HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual copy to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copied to the .kim file, copied & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is limit image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, because the .kin file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File import... select, becomes & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders you want to copy the importing images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box to import which categories of the file to be imported, and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database. you can see an example for this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and watch pictures: when you see pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the different steps of (1) Setting up the information about your pictures, about (2) searching and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically reuses this in future startup. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start a different folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings possibilities of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as to how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete list of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">See the settings available to you for setting up the list of members. in the list above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares its module system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; they are, but are sold separately. most of the modules have a help page which you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared among each other together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own pictures. the demo database can be accessed either through the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't tell, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications which use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage of sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & photoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, shows all the pictures that the picture preview currently shows.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum has to be released; the modules also have a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category people, for example, will do & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you would have selected persons to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are not compatible with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the Settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the picture to show you an overview of all the available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons on the picture where the picture has been recorded, etc. you can set each picture either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">Here you can see three lists with a text field by specifying people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and the same 5-10 persons can be mapped on all 50 pictures, you can find that the names used are moved upwards, find the persons faster and arrange them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical sorted list, click on the Sorting icon by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and have these pictures with annotations. in this case, simply click on the thumbnails and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the United States. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overview. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. in addition, you can simply drag an entry into a category and put it there to add it to a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to get this window shown again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the type of pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all the pictures if you do not have a filter. you can see the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be shown in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely images, without having to store them on the hard disk. of course you need to save the images somewhere, hence & kphotoalbum; you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are present for the pictures 5-9, so that the thumbnails can be previewed. however, you can't view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and re-copy it again. & kphotoalbum; does not support you to avoid creating the CD so far. so if you want to avoid trouble, such as the mess of your pictures, please buy a bigger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end ones you want to make for others unavailable and click Current View in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister may see, control the menu entry All out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry images to lock, which eliminates all the images you have locked. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is not very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours with that you spend them at some point. for this reason features & kphotoalbum; about an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course, he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and place them somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Poss1 and the end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slideshow. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus. the slide will be stopped by pressing Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and out of the picture. with the minus button you can easily pull out a rectangle with the mouse button. with the minus button you can re-zoom in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed out. with the uniformity-key, the zoom sets the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. you can see this. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever has always selected, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you display categories in the Indre preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the character after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on which was painted. to switch to the coloring mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture from the context menu. to exit the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; to work, you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not entirely rule, but the documentation to & Povray; should you necessarily have read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then click on Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each item has a feasibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their degree of visibility is smaller or equal to the stage of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">The object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you want. you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the player to the top or bottom of a view. then a rectangle will display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the player to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on one another, drag the player in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window ordering are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchoring, drag the button on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the top left in the fascia bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the fascia bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with view window layout... to save it. a dialog is displayed in which you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 is current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering on the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full picture in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View menu, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image section for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflection light. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or steps effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling uses the neighbouring pixels with it. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively because each pixel is always further divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference between color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a particular number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn Yittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays do not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finishes, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you don't support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object reception of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach for projections but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you tick the bottom, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the floor is displayed in a board pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window instructions, you will explain how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Default Window System: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window ordering when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected order with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window layout is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with map card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and hoverend anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without closer knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything installed correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name Camera. when you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the camera's basic settings, this is subject to later guidance, but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the Application button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a Quader (insert final body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite final level. if you rename the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the item to the bottom when you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise one unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something more simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box where you can select how to add the object. please select first object. you can then change the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with one click on the preview see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on the preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but take the simplest one.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then press the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you rename your image with one click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the Color List you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. select the color list in the object tree. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the box color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done just as you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovModeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the button or the Apply button) so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put a suitable material in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then choose Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a Render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected when you have used editing return.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to change default shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar. you can add and remove commands with this option Toolsymbols for & kpovModeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kudexshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can click with clicking on the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether any image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images are to always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first characters of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Beginning require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; every KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Specifies the script to display the setup dialog. to store and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok will set the workfolder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signals that a new piece is popped up. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece using DCOP functions (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume Signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Provides the path to the selected files in the playlist, if a custom menu entry can be clicked. to add one's entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle) to remove the entry.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to do clean-up operations. for example, this includes saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2) .bz2 so that the user can clearly detect the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 only accept script packages with the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should designate your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you must have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimum.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presupposes that your window manager maintains the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Most likely one of your files will cause an error in the TagLib library. you can locate the file by clicking ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok; compiled libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when processing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "The file $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: mplib; my $mp3 = get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "without $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined icon: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any collimator Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please enter only one error if you are interested in fixing an error in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come into it now?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start window has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (eg SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you to find the cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different Sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decode it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decode the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with the highest priority (real time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. the magnifying sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers lots of different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime menu. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also found under the scroll menu. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or adjust the volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and change to the next or last piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the Equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the Player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the Equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the fullness of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows different information regarding the current part. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may have noticed that the Start window will drop off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz icon you will find further information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats can have any name, but images with the word front in the name are preferred preferred. the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. when you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running track. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text sub-window, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics text. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. for this, no running text script is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button searches a search on google.com according to the text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are omitted.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / year - album - sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and then sorted by performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a drop-down menu with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leaks the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry gives you the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you are asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / Burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) move files into the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, and it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up a compilation mark - Changes a record marked album back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists quite simple. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser includes the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are also possible. click Smart Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with a lot of files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter key, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the appending of the Shift key can be difficult. in this case, the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: as a result, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter letters there, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. for example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then wrap the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contains, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations at will. for example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key and then right-click in the desired order. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, follow the undo and restore buttons. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you see in the player window via the right mouse button. via this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's Configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar buttons... select.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking with the mouse double in the respective display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the Status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the Player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualisations of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can consider all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece in the queue, a number appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predefined (details of setting up these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you do not need a load .fm profile to make this dynamic playlist work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Load. thus, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist. so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist Recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as the start point. the dynamic mode can also be deactivated using the same menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New Fill button empties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. playlist Edit opens the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played songs - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. thus, you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play. if you set more than 1, the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you tick multiple playlists, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it.</seg>

<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can choose from the appearing dialog files to add to the project. this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Open the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described via the What is the? aid (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful if you are not using files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session will always be included, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function will cause & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD-Copy dialog. this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create only one copy of a CD which you can burn later on. you should also prefer cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It also allows you to create only one copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later on. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the Copy dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog for deleting a CD-RW. this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W) so the content is completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burning a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burn button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burn button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously used DVD video can be converted. this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, coding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbar of & k3b; if an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and blocking of the disk or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content view allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for & k3b. once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key assignment for it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrators will need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is designed for personalizing and tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the functional scope, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the included programs will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void copyrights () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can get a project using the # dcop k3b K3b interface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bDataProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void renameItem (QString path, QString) void setVolume ID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dco</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; read for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are also possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encodes these wav files (This coerver packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution). additional encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all of these programs are usually present for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile a bit yourself. however, only the encoders must be installed that are needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the & CD;. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid buying copied audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling to read a & CD is explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or work completely without a network, whereby everything is manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step example, you'll find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the establishment of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case must first connect to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the set-up menu - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already expired file is selected for coding instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (like protocols, piepsen) for program events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudioCreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, to set up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences become less important, since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame will still be included with most distributions but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate app. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a track. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car ostereozers. but not good enough for better stereo stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdriven for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; can be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the computer itself. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (the author of the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information released on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be damaged. any information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for using freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address when retrieving data from the server does not use (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD; to save wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read wav files, the encover and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) are on the tab for setting the coding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The coerver package must be installed by the corresponding Linux distribution before the coerver can be used. this is also required for predefined coerers. more information about coerers is found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio coerers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; please check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood all, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write breaches on it (eg by trying to copy something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the codec to be used for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy, let us share the program to use freedb to download the freedb to download the files from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them when reading a & CD; change if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive exists, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select for incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately begins reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries that are resulting from it. the directory or filename is changed with Konquordin- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database beforehand. to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should be received? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: apologies, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? read and add parallel reading and coding? the author does not know it, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; eject after reading the last piece: check this to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another disk. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything just as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be smoothed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the production of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music cleverly, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on hard disk, was described in the previous section and setup. first, a connection to the Internet is built, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different than those for a & CD; with success of freedb collected data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually enter, instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for questions and answers to the help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles are already filled in and the name of the artist and album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives, a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Actual Title' unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field below can be used for each piece of comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you don't just start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with upper case letters start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; this option is set on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the 'Basic Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encover in order to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not provide the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second one." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and album are shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or out. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what expires.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3. thus, read and encoding parallel. notice the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the computer with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and encoding (though, of course, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & conqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played after each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and going back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tempoad and so change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics event and again others. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set up the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the Settings menu the entries text events and events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played by the series. in this section is how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu item under the Organize... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the files in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialogue appears, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is added automatically to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is re-determined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter because it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map will translate General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all occurrences of the Change patch to Bright Piano events in the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section which may appear as many times as desired. but a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap..." END Define keymap "An additional keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support can be for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches from General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so do not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to place all sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun shot (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a score with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to form notes on the percussion channel. see for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, trying to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, it will be converted with the n * (r / 4096) formula and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM plans that a keyboard that gets a Pitch Bender event with the value 4096 to play a ton higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the View channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to produce very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed, etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kmid workspace on a & kde; -Desktop with my MIDI Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or go (if I want to play a MIDI file) or play a file, just change to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the & kmid window;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting Automatic Adding to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you just want to play the first file. so, set the setting Automatic Adding to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, the program inspires me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies but I try to take a little time. as hobbies I have programming, MIDI files collect, make music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or, if you simply want to make me happy, write to me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list with friends of & kmid; if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my free time and no one gets money for it. I want to emphasize that I can only further program because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - fixing the error that the pitch of EEE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can track the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can of course hear no music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries played after each other, you should use the category persistent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarchy. if you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. simply click on a name of a category click on it from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a sub-group, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlists from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically stopped by opening another source. however, this would interfere with the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab to configure MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of SMB. here's the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special video embed embed video in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">That the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages must be the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is started in a console application and searches for error messages regarding the load of the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the Backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is always taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stolen, the device to use and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of SMB only supports XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses various names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation are dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter if I play from it (not from VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as a user root after installing the device. it is essential to ensure that / dev / cdrom can be seen on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be tested for their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. Unix-like systems are probably used for the package & texlive; respectively & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; project contains some already compiled packages of & Kile; for various distributions. these enable simple installation without further compiling and are included on the box; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact should be made about the box; website.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have questions about and / or compiling & kile, or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed at the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; desktop. & Kile; offers the possibility to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. finally, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and to learn about its possibilities, the manual can be drawn to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct pronouncement: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to operate, can also use a laie (engl. lay) & latex; -Makros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While there is only a good overview about & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to do it. to control & latex; good books, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other markup languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general properties like paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be re-closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Introduction Wizard from & Kile; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in & Kile;. the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some options for creating the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this includes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [report], Articles (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. UTF-8x should be used increasingly (for the correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-ons for & latex; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Scripture (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source text editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & Kile, it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When setting a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile, the command generates an empty line (for example\\ end {command}). this function can be activated in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the most common and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective button.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file is created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding row in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and to print from DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the box search, the elements of the DVI; file were clicked with the editor and once clicked to an element in the DVI; file was clicked to the corresponding section in the & latex; source text was clicked to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. a master document simplifies the work with other .tex files. a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings when using a project.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is wasted and no call from & eyepiece is done; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the Edit Toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for fast incorporation of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, marks or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified designation (select a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex, this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã © es is used for defining the font size. it can be used to set the font for the main text, the marks, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source sample has been entered, the & latex; source code needs to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the MenÃ ¼ s building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source text must be stored before compiling. & Kile; performs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document is compiling, it should be searched for errors in the log file. if it is not the case, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows to change the font size inside the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only considered within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many options to obtain the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be recursively represented with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is presented to write the source code with the & latex; markup language, now follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. for this, a quote, a few places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">These files are created by & tex; or & latex; there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps are necessary as required for creating the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion can start into swapped other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binder files. to this end, only Modern under Settings Kile needs to be set up... Tools Building out.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on to the default search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the appropriate & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. for this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; as a text editor (setting up the settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should not open when using Rapture of the & DVI; viewers can't open, an error can be found. if an error is present, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file erases the source code error source. in the editor, the executable LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. to view the error line, the error must be clicked on the error in the log and & box; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the button on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be re-written or used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by publishing an existing document and selecting file template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into a document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry for the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if a simple way to create a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& box; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly from & Kile in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its options should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be accessed over the menu help LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all the commands in & latex; use can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click on the right Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way you can select the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When the arrow keys are used, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the different types of source texts and highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the MenÃ ¼ Responses Edit jump marks or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump-mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Edit is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like & Kile;. although & kate; already excellent options, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is always added & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this only preventative thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command is also available & latex; -commands with a return value (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove are the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is contained in the description to the Edit Items section.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore provides & kile; for more commands under Edit Environment for a more possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command you jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ begin {surrounding} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can be quickly lost. this command is close to the last opened environment, so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command you jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command you jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curving bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curly staple of a & tex; group #, is sprayed to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested group clamps quickly the overview can be lost. this command complete the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application characters are used as a number. for the appropriate implementation is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple quotes. also for the end of the application the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and provides two close-to-date quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in any language specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French requirements. many other languages are also available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">For Shift; Enter key for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, complete & box; the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; Set... LaTeX will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby arrange all the Et-characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; try to add this to the next tab. although this tabulator is not the associated, & Kile; some intermediate spaces for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, this has been added in & Kile; to add special commands (mostly for & latex;), three are built for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Kile... can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {surrounding} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surrounding} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and the full list is possible. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be added, so that a jump to these positions is possible by means of the Edit Folder Nest jump token and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; can make settings to these lists. there can be different Walls for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. it must always have a few letters entered with\\ begin and the execution mode will have a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are often used that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full edit mode, the surrounding area or the key-key Alt + Shift key is automatically captured by the command to open the environment and it appears\\ begin. after that, the surrounding execution can be continued in the simplest way, and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. as soon as the box detects that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; can be done by default settings to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of shutters that are immediately replaced by lumpy strings. lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be fully furnished. as an example of a check list, the example.cwl file, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word is filled with full-time editing or key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large owners are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noticed that many WÃ ¤ns are written in a document more than once. thus offers & Kile; the completion for all already written documents.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Kile can be fully defied. here, the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The dialog with graphics allows the creation of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be considered and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and rearrangements of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all construction tools are compiled in groups, creating compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by keyboard Alt; 2. after that the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer by Alt; 3, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and be viewed using the old; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Fast Construction command, a viewer is normally called after compiling. if no displayed viewer should be used, each time a new window is opened.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being asked about the project New Project.... Find the following information for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a full manual for the & latex; commands contained and is thus ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & Kile; into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; extradited, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help provides & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk that contains a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and here for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile; only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles within the project, such as team leader and sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and the button Setze as expresses. the currently selected member (their identity) will appear bold after they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and setting of one's own identity are important in terms of news and notes. see for further information about notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters a file into the CVS, as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the address can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">There can be either the note entry from the Editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the set nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the parenthesis and: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1951">"" "large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal" "" "bumpy caps" "" "means that the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tagXML files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end tag: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent notes: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. using button default, the default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that in a power failure or crash when the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be viewed either in the editor pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default settings to the default on the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by modifying the MDI modes and andocken / off of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning notifications range is used to control the display of warnings from non-polls by means of hooks.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location around the behavior of & VPL; to change. it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the Parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree using the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the field of Structure Tree Settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree during editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty groups are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The section for setting abbreviations (a type of templates) that will be unfolded while editing to larger text. abbreviations are grouped in groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading component in the read-only mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Read-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging was completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed, with time numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger so that the normal case does not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Start the session. includes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initialize a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and constantly send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will be continued. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if a request is given, the execution begins as soon as a request is set.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two ways, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folder contains two file types, the text and instructions are inserted faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML Files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable a quick insertion of tags into a document without danger of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">This text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. may be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouped together by the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Whitespace does not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and select TagXML. to select. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.day.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a functioning family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = returns; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as easy and there is an editor to access via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD-indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New action to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User Language button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detector settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / mysqt.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, like sh% scriptdir / mysqt.sh. This way the script tries to find: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; only an instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input can be input by & quantaplus. in the input field, you can specify what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output output; error messages, to the default output output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use their use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available, so that an input while using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered to be loosely, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is indicated that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; startgt; -day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so it is still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into several groups.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After reeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc, so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension to & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the script language or formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to find an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = their description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation for example:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the carton (except through reason), but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of docrc file that serves to form context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; -scripts should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; this is the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (just as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email sending, toolbox toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it. the posts are reviewed and only available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publication. to make a new contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for which there is a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for their private gpg key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can search for. in the New resource dialog the input fields have to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, upload tool bars, and start the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in the event of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages that are not currently supported by & quantaplus; but the creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD menu and convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them closer to these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the work area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that only this user can use them personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; samples to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which embeds the common use of special tools and patterns within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of a number of main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please suggest to and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all flashcards, reload, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the editor pane will lead to a further context menu on how basic editing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor. currently it takes & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbar buttons is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can enter the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanvisions (QIT;) make it possible to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and wander through. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows the administrator to manage the files in the project by right-clicking. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deletion of the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc; All possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used. the category hangs by & quantaplus; workarea. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, manfast attributes and namespaces can change. the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed by adding a folder doc to a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two flashcards at the bottom of the window, which can be reached via useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; -scripts executed, give all error messages (so it is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Chocolate page of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer in pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the aforementioned claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details are available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; write so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; -script error messages are displayed!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">On and off the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, it will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the .webprj file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy video files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbars. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by means of Settings... Settings. toolbar buttons are saved by means of toolbar buttons, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbar buttons to the main server, where anyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar refuses when this day is contradicted by the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above. click on it. clicking on an activated plug-in will deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. with the selection of an entry, the corresponding sub-window will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; for details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which can be added and the sequences can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out from top to bottom, as for example after filling out the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project is automatically completed. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is automatically filled in.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.example) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol are used. depending on the remote computer setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be hooked up. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a detailed selection of good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the checkbox, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profile or using the Shift; F7 key.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are re-read for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by checking its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot currently be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the icon Open Project from the toolbar. the dialog Open Project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before publishing, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project structure gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave similarly, but the opening and opening entries are missing... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten in the program window. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsecure password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is saved on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply docking the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project toolbar or the Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps to increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbar bars in & quantaplus; best stageable via the toolbar. use and addition differentiate. adding toolbar buttons is treated below in the section Add toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be removed, toolbars rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be displayed in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action edited which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and specify the settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code schnitzel and files for linking. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are written in corresponding subfolders. some examples can be found in the template tree using global templates. see for more information on the template Tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area always in the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template Save As local template save....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right of the file tree or in the project file tree view, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, the project folder is backed up, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can specify headlines and footers or dynamically using & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things in the use of templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded once the parent attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like plain text. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a preordered or rearranged text for templates in this folder. this could be common headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers by copying contents templates into a folder with special headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back if necessary to the source code editor, in which the executed changes in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document containing & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the Vohandiness of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor in synchron. pressing F9, this mode is active, the keyboard press moves the active cursor from one window to the other, where the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be set via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatic. in principle, the recommendation can be set between synchronisation after a click or automatic. basically, the recommendation applies: a small breakdown for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, tools document properties can be selected. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the content, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves independently. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or a distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that the insert of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted, enclosed with text, any other adjacent anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons, such as the tables assistant or the list assistant, are disabled. later, they will work in the & VPL; the tables or lists will need to be used in this release.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for studying style sheets. unlike other style templates, searching for specific elements is possible and the style of style can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time correcting a lot in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any amount of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">3-way merging is also fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the merging editor under the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are shown visibly. if lines only differ in a number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more anger if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in a line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ from files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 -o destination folder kdiff3 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o Destinations Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to manually set file names, select the file browser (file...) or select a last opened file from the drop-down list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons and / or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but a folder is used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the comparisons / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you don't need to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop you: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do nothing out of & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while over the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the abstraction column from the text will be interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line will be shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Gemodified] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe button to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line is selected in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also cause a jump of the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merge or by manual editing, no further line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the Quel; displayed. this is just a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The Text & lt; Context Context; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the options are ignored when selecting the sources or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the left, right, up, down, side on, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. by inserting button you can switch between plug-in and over-write mode. (default is the plug-in mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merging and editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image forward / Ctrl-Image downwards) or the next / previous conflict. therefore, conflicts must be differentiated between resolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is enabled, whatever you mark, will automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copy. however, be careful with this option, because you may overwrite the contents of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors do not use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use chariot return + line boost\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line-ends of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored at the next start. (Set up menu Settings &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the selected script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be routed. on these systems the button presets automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tablator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the input of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line delay '\' at the end of a line, others save only a newline character, although they are different. if this option is enabled, auto-return signs will be made visible, but like a white sign. while merging this option, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still shown, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled by default. it is effective for complex and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unsolved conflict is going.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Features Choose A / B / C for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation for the comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Change the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must & kdiff3; exit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the Control Center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding appears a short note about what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, you may only see the differences between two of three files. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; -gt; C will display a second overlook column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then unexpectedly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. if a normal command line command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command line. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users don't want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line command line to convert the entry into upper case letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $keyword $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another line-off command. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so practically erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / RegExp / Rep / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs a few details. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-down algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really carrying out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merging of individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by double the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of the problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when all contents are identical. then folders also have the same color. for folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option to synchronize directories is active. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option to select new file instead of merging (unsure) is checked & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging is done one file after the other. it status column indicates if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unsolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resoluted conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, C will be used as a target in the Three-folder Merge mode, B will be used as a target and when syncing A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (shortcut shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box appears with the options Browse, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you first want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; executes certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">Once you're done with a file, select / continue directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then, & kdiff3 will continue to work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; crashes on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), allow & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again later. even if the merge action has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (Set menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. several patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not need to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elemental-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignoring files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-matically generated files are ignored by CVS. the major advantage is that this folder can be set to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not included for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an end loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changeset date and file size. this speed advantage, however, will cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. no real comparison occurs. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the date of modification. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enable synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the results are selected to merge so that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying of the newer file is proposed as action instead of merging the newer file as action. (this is considered insecure because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not just merging whole folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view will remain visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file directly by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu. you can also merge a single file directly from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifying date. therefore, the permissions or the change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first with the built-in differences viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDifficPart display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needed & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; then removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; the program patch to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part performed, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compact) already. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge like the diff3 program from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot while looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably don't tell the configure script to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE does not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines, next to each other, this is is the case the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source text and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more upliftment would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found in http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake uses, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties arise, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position, resp. replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries showing differences. this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will fail after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. farewells in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working areas, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works within a desktop as well as on several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle mouse button allows windows to be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager... and Finish. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, Windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field indicates the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are provided with Ordinel Figures, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its default icon and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the layout of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & kpager; in a 2xN grid, like from pager applications in some other window managers appear; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the windows as symbols or with its contents and move it. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like & kedit; or vi. If you don't have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you will need to enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign a value to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you start & Kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifier window.. The image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you may choose & Kmag; to make a selected screen area in the magnification window (select window mode) or the surrounding of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the cursor to the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift; press Shift or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; possesses a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode a selection window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer resides for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from the RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury syndrome) and which each mouse-click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer resides for a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also cause pain caused by the mere moving of your mouse. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoiding pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be omitted for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, power & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be logged after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool, executing a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intellect is switched on, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutting down the mouse button wait before it releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears to be delayed, you can shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider bar sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at any start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should be switched off at first. if you then have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later increase the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse-click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral component of windows or in places in the browser window that does not show a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the side of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started an imposition. if you use the intelligent shift in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will return the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continuing to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the tool bars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to highlight text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some suggestions for this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; select text instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click away. so you know exactly when when the smart move starts moving the shift time. later, you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the XTest extension for & X Window; should be installed on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer resins. this program has been developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and which the antigen of the mouse button causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time to start a dragging process before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2531">With the program & kmouth, silent users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets which are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot) enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text. for more details see the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page you can choose the default text passage. from the text passages you can choose frequently used text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary. & kmouth; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can compare the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words will be included in the vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keystrokes of your movements (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a memory of the already spoken phrases (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have done properly, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is appended to the memory memory. you can select sets that are to be spoken again.</seg>

<seg id="2538">Enter the language generator's input field in the input field. in the selection field below the input field, you specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed on as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command to voice output depends on your language generator. you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator. examples for this can be found in the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Using possible kttsd as a language service will be used & kmouth; as first try to pass the text to the KTTSD language service. if this is successful, the further settings on this page are ignored. the kttsd language service is a & kde; -Dammon, the & kde; -Applications a standardized interface for voice output is available. the choice of this option is useful even if KTTSD is not installed.</seg>
<seg id="2543">With the first selection field action after selecting a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by key shortcuts or by selecting a text passage in the textbox menu or in the toolbox for text passages.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of Sofort the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory. the selected text passage is only entered in the input field with the selection of Add to the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">With the second drop of the editing window for text passages, you can specify whether the text passagebook should be automatically saved when closing the editing window.</seg>

<seg id="2547">The vocabulary page contains a list of dictionaries for the vocabulary. in the main window beside the input field shows & kmouth; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary. with this selection field, you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list you can select the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde documentation. the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the assignment. in addition, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option, you can merge the dictionaries available. & kmouth; then ask which dictionaries are merged and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option, you set a new, empty dictionary without entries. da & kmouth; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window to edit text passages is divided. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated shortcut. if you have selected a text passage, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books can be reached either by selecting in the menu bar, on the toolbar or through a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dragging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the & Alt; button.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each job you receive from the card card is a text assignment. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one that reads, this output is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacers replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with predefined string replacement filters that enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters, you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts. if you have set a female voice for example on the cardboard card speaker, you can read text by KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text assignment, message, warning or & node is sent to & ktts, it is edited by all activated filters installed on the bottom of the page. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the set normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not checked and is not used. filter will be processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and you will see the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for setting fonts. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed from top to bottom in the order displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons lets you load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2645">You get the application ID running programs with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers you need to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 indicates, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter is applied to the text only if all conditions correspond to an entry in the box Diesen Filter if the filter is in agreement. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the character set filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separator (whitespace) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Enter the xsltproc User Language program. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection Filter you can send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the cardboard card speaker, or to a speaker with specific characteristics. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; there is a text attached to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board spokesman. with the speaker selection filter you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and punctuation detection filter (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sentences. this can begin faster with reading, since only the first movement needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the punctuation detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; a punctuation detection filter is automatically set up as an input. you can change its settings or add other set limits filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way, you will learn how to set up the Speaker Selection. turn on the Speaker Selection and select text to read. switch on the Speaker Selection menu, change some properties and check how the Speaker's selection changes. for this, you must have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then can start faster with reading, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel orders on the map card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal punctuation filter filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything to this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Character Recognition Filters compare text with a regular expression for propositions and insert a tabulator (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard propositional filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -messages (cries), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation filter from mistake, you can insert it back by loading the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The Speaker card chooser can be used to overwrite the application settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card board spokesman). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the features of an equipped speaker. if you do not delete or edit the Speaker's settings, choose this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the spokesperson, which is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box when the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several marks.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the Speaker area, the most likely to delete the following, click on the Default icon and then use Spokesman closest to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2752">The voice speed settings are ignored if & tts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is changed into SSML.) Please enable either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reformed filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and usage of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & knetworkconf; that allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting a kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must be fully installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up with installing and setup. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and release level. by marking the non-return requests the definition can be made permanently. the next start of the network settings will automatically preset this selection.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the right lower end of the module.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... to be edited in the Device Configuration dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode the TCP / IP settings are made for the system at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system startup, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the Device List.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need. switching on an outdated network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be enabled or disabled according to need. switching off an enabled network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>

<seg id="2819">If more than one network interface is available on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name into an IP address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution of the name resolution part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be rearranged by selecting an entry and up or downgrading in the list with the Hinds or Herb buttons in the top priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... button from the group Computer to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Computer to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. the Edit dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named specifies machine name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting, if no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list contains especially known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well known computer and click Add... Add New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well known computer and click the Add button. if the well known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog known calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second all of & knetwork.conf; variable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description concentrates on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, am & eg; the network administrator is the contact point that assigns a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.01.0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is needed for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually the address is 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which operates as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part are the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2891">Cron, for example Vixie cron. & kcron; uses the crontab command to change the user's schedules.</seg>
<seg id="2892">A POSIX conformes & UNIX; for example with glibc. & kcron; uses standard commands from & UNIX; to learn time and date.</seg>
<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; console the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; the band does not record the band, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the prune, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was mounted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the volume by unfolding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& K; by changing the symbol for the tape, it shows that the integration for the tape was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat; if your tape drive assumes that a tape can be formatted before use, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you toggle the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens up for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog will appear for checking. in this dialog you can check once your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you have confirmed the check-in settings, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the restore settings, the Recover will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band index.This process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can re-create the index in two ways from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... make the settings in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path needs to refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is involved, load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option enabled, tries & kdat; to lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape will be disconnected; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option for floppy embankers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tried & kdat; the hardwardly block size for tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to tell & kdat; in any case, the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the epoch in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be handled directly with & GNU; - tar - even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog allows users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows users to quickly access information about issues that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; so try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of specific programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog provides, with the help of which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filters and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog tries to open the system log; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not start you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter to a selected filter. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if the string containing the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as Protocol lines of level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to skip to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new log lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol for the display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find further information about the Sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion-Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is quickly becoming standard for the control of the program starts when booting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without re-installing and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to start when booting the system or changing to a different runtime. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services, on the other hand, do not include setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something at high speed, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places according to the program init and starts the first one that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runtime is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have completed something, then you can repair it by reboot the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runtime that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. furthermore, I could still have a user runtime, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runtime levels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. the entry will be removed from its initial runtime (or its position). this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to only copy them to a new run level, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you will need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the different work areas (Available System Services, RunLevel 1 Start, RunLevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired run level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevels, and now the machine is continually restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for executing under RunLevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminating without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; runtime varies from distribution to distribution, can be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made any changes, you need to save it. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. for editing, select the desired user or the group you want with double-click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. further card cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card card password management appears when Shadow -passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least one embedded file system limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the limitations of the space are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
