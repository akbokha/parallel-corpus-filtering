although I had visited the US for at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and operated their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist for an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magnet , who wanted to occupy the top German court with judges who were inclined his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stays behind the mountain as they say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declare his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and its voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing human being with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung also did not agree with the current editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , struggling for the environment for a lifetime , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew leak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me much in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp took his path to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their churches are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The White against all other ethnic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as the big van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America means everyone welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of speech with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is that not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that is Tru@@ mp@@ s Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists but worlds away from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found an opportunity to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and gave the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from tr@@ ash
the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village that is practically on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ er under the guidance of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez has started to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cello , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made out of the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , of Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the tr@@ ash . kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them didn &apos;t live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about 1 billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated in Liber@@ ian waters of illegal fishing , before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and less inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles were mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
ultimately it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( stopping Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed and work together . they exchange information and stand each other at where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information between individual countries , these actions are happening in real time , with trac@@ e@@ ability at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . such suspici@@ ons can also be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship is inviting its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost sales that the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year lose due to illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fis@@ her , which attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , fake lic@@ ences , specifying of fanta@@ sies , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship used to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You dar@@ st not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Office for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , also helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to cross @-@ crossed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , a NGO that also deals with fishing data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that links different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal operating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can be used to display the position of every tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and gather their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to f@@ use without a license and hardly have had consequences , now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile reached a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there six countries joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they now fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; security is the aim of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and used tow@@ ing networks , which are meanwhile banned .
the ship was also steep@@ ed in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans really works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning &quot; the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the presidential election of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the Return of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north German Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is continuously wor@@ sen@@ ing , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ an people by an acute shortage of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the ten@@ se of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluc@@ t@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on ten@@ ure for many was the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were united , called upon the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the day of torture and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , continued to pers@@ ist .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ conqu@@ ering Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently divided images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter there are pictures that tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony against the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many nation @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have !
meanwhile an inf@@ ographic already makes the round , which forms the extent of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term in office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many people in the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your term of office !
on the street !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to clo@@ the critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now acting as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba , against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
he retained the secret of his family for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 in La Per@@ la prison until 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ o &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with an ERP .
pass only on that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and then I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
at the military base I had to destroy documents that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ as the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were turned off and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed inside and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that she fastened it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a 220 Volt load into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fying ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I knew these people were killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore braces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men were lying down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept silence on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did@@ st thou bring me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and buried and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , accused students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial site La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the de@@ human@@ izing process .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mean &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war crime &quot; - as they knew - was .
but when I was in the army later - I was in gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war crimes are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothing , painting , money ... it is not a war crime but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the director of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who shou@@ ld@@ est take cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , hit me and scre@@ amed :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do so !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a rolling collar pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
back then the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children dec@@ eive ?
one day my father brought a girl with me home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom one could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains forever .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought to display my father arose during a conversation when he stood under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then give me time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can imagine that I &apos;m pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I finally testified against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 years old child .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court hang@@ ed life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the Swiss Chamber of Commerce :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have been working for justice for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be established , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where one can extend his driving license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , witnessed a particularly dis@@ mis@@ understood translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fal@@ sely - perhaps also with vi@@ cious h@@ ind and # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisement in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared among the social media .
the mistake occurred to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally not correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are really sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ ori@@ sts . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts who are involved in accidents across the country is quite an occasion to concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors convic@@ ted 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by senior citizens has increased in the same period .
the not @-@ called re@@ porter introduced comments to the light published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation errors received among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation actually not , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widely distributed in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the native language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies , which do not have foreign employees , can still produce translations within the company . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are assessed as the best , will be made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the adverti@@ sed and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that arise by machine translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , by large companies or by government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship take place on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; portal ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online broad@@ ca@@ ster .
later , other users wrote that the Internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , who resist the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a trac@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was coupled , and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server queries of certain domains respond er@@ ron@@ eous .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the broadcast was set on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Tina is fighting for children &apos;s rights and g@@ athers witness statements from other Cri@@ adi@@ ans who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of Kur@@ tural .
the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ tural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to perform countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that in the context of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay based on participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ lla - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , as the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated against Cri@@ mean is generally still silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make a difference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with herself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly after , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the Population Register Office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ adi@@ os are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ Job@@ bik in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
her brothers had to work all now and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she puri@@ fied the fridge , brus@@ hed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they were done with learning the more free time they had .
but even this time was limited because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but did not get an unlimited meal . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the master &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings , the master Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her not to give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had enabled .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships are born , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;

starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ eventh girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by also offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad once again :

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and personnel ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and cur@@ tail@@ ed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , since the draft does not give an indication of how Egyptian authorities should make up registration for users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliamentary co @-@ ordin@@ ator and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to that it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for personal rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that , just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative Parliament and the constitutional committees , before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and will ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says .
last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; increasing protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdist@@ an in the north @-@ east Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain kind of Leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to actually see a Persian Leop@@ ards is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress that had been hit in the last six years to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture has been a pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tural pre@@ f@@ ecture in the north @-@ east , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the N@@ eigh@@ bours of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced an atomic accident , even so that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from the local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o special report shows which progress has been made six years later in order to re@@ construct the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such buildings , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 per cent .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from accommodation shel@@ ters ( which is to be evacu@@ ated , Kaz@@ et@@ su Ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) , are still trying to res@@ ett@@ le in final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in these dwell@@ ings .
nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated homes were res@@ ett@@ led in homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i fishing har@@ bours are now in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma res@@ um@@ ed only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours .
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by 5 400 hectares of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma land are located in the nuclear barrier zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist arri@@ vals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants have found it more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her feeling changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents find that there has still not been enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been converted into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people who are still in homes are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music prevailed during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after having been hit by the police at nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him to the head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . in the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and took him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local photo@@ journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active ministry until completion of the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officers how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive station , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media @-@ activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web , in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer , and several san@@ ity will rush to him shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had joined , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and here was a sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a head@@ stock .
police hand@@ grips
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which there was brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by guiding the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognized if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages For@@ gotten by de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ e Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is standing up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene reminds himself that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ am I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw already better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dated , and barely competitive , they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the 2001 level ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all of the respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents that were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was transferred and the letters were more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he assured .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ ch was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for employment and services generated in the congregations in which they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ e Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to remove them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other establishments .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harvest brought the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ ines per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a re@@ trac@@ table person , nevertheless he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is in pension for 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young@@ sters use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and to preserve their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording a song from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do so through Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by ped@@ agog@@ ues David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop is thus one that the young participants discuss topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street in Western Canada , where almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases have mostly not been elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ ro@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung at Cre@@ e .
the you@@ ths involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because we have lost our way in life as youth
but I believe that we will lift ourselves up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language make a contribution and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( where to see , &quot; Plas@@ tische Typ@@ es of the dishes &quot; ) of every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see themselves these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a multitude of these small businesses that produce even those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is now turned into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now on special sale : new with plastic courts decorated cell phone bands , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in ess@@ ences is becoming more complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we have also made this part for the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing up@@ turn into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone support and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone support has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic courts you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic courts are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of national and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive whole communities for so many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid lives life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and look for graves , according to the people whom we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get these ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they mo@@ urn those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something is happening to them as well .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to argue that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how an armed criminals put money for month &apos;s money from their shop until they end up not only destroying the business , but also torn apart their family .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma stops , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man &apos;s government for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office had 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) WH@@ Y : this post and the pages to which it links contains images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising ru@@ mo@@ urs or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fications .
but how is the years after something appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial publication , it has been mis@@ guided to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
authorities &apos; representatives described a fire@@ ball that covered dozens of houses including a movie that was full of people watching football world champion@@ ships .
houses burned and char@@ med cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the da@@ zz@@ ling scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of glued bodies , which are lined up on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was repeated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed real but not associated trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dramatically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses were buried in streets and bushes .
there were reports of which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be represented on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
still one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash@@ light , published by the United Nations , those who escaped were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which wrong@@ ly claimed that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed recently on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations who called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the picture from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false dec@@ ou@@ pling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the reported picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private pages , social media platforms and community and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed through false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have included examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what page they had been published on which side they were published .
several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also connected with each other ) .
here are some cases which can now be fully r@@ ins@@ ed ( on the card in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country studies of false coupl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available for example of for@@ geri@@ es or false messages .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to present counter@@ f@@ eit studies .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image of the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( aimed at Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that reads ru@@ mo@@ urs asked that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not just mention the mis@@ statement , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved therein ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; have clearly not seen pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the image since 2011 in association with Nigeria , back then promoted by a post of American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .

this article draws attention to the ongoing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article of the Indian Express with the image of the DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express did not contain this picture at the time of publishing our contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Greece , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

the shock@@ ing photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fac@@ te check page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of theology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to the support of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was seen as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , with a twe@@ et showing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an Mass@@ ac@@ re and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government released a right to judge what it meant as &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this judgment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natur@@ al@@ ect@@ omy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar went into being in 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic closely standing news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not of the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it constitutes a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in the context of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was ev@@ oked as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .

after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here on Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the embassy in which the picture was contained in DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos had dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately provide a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that perme@@ ate these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study investigating how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to debate about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used by context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated .
these words are in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these insur@@ moun@@ table words are well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ Mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu , including :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Art for your parents in recognition of how you have been trying in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having been war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ rau@@ d other cultures , reveal other lines of thought and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite villages here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ fall catastrophe in this decade .
the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ t@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have res@@ ig@@ ned in 15 districts in the south and west of the country through strong rainf@@ alls in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an emergency centre on May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
high @-@ water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water stands of up to 7.5 metres . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gue crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle likewise flooded because of yesterday &apos;s sur@@ passed water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue team need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded for free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ish Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March took place on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
use approved . at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust in her my four year old daughter , she trusted in me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the last minute we are calling for par@@ ole for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next round , we den@@ ounce the rights for Trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ an@@ ding slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has established itself in its conception .
they de@@ ath@@ ize me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective perception that as soon as Muslims who do not fit into it , they will be Muslim .
dem@@ i ci@@ li@@ zation are being developed
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of pictures do you think about when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this deletion makes a major part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims that have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ assembled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US couldn &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong fol@@ ly weak@@ ens Muslim women who perform movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has made our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create sc@@ ars that help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the burden of 1.7 billion dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ American Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
approved .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were in@@ capable of Muslims and Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now a member of the Muslim and the American ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always chosen for additional checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have already manipul@@ ated our er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and multi@@ faceted that it cannot fit into a drawer .
the author 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ garten group .
approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim was first born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabian verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon contest in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as she gained a competition in the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of the Su@@ fi saint ; and a Qur &apos;an containing many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me to speak if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , which means God , my only Lord .
for a nation that - for centuries - has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; which has founded a company called the Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Eastern Com@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow up and to hear that men don &apos;t we@@ ep , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he had not allowed to close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century ago by a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir@@ ish under@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ incorporated history .
it means remember@@ ing that 14 years ago , the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to hunt mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried among the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when tragedy hits the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that , fourteen hundred years ago , the first call to prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , is the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islamic anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim Regi@@ ons that began with President Bush and were wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs which we reject Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University revealed a scientifically valid picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are deeply involved in enth@@ ron@@ izing the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous ima@@ gery that we ste@@ er in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black American Muslims ; S@@ ay Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print increasingly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences which go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given to them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not conscious when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me an indispensable Muslim today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things I have left here like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bread@@ crum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie , where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations will take place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than 100 academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are conducted , and people who have been enth@@ ron@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination four decades ago , was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I en@@ vision in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because of the fact that we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed broken lands and &quot; to other &quot; made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for stor@@ y@@ telling wants to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now , despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of language of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not very small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass death of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , soci@@ alize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language first and translate or explain it in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience re@@ members it .
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Con@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ hu@@ ara tells the story of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ hu@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story telling .
Puerto Rico demands new determination of government debt by the US
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the mon@@ arch@@ ic Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church council of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities who are responsible for debts are to be held responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions related remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; is a non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Rico requires a broad restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night guard for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and families continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event devoted to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The cost of freedom : collective rep@@ lication ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build mo@@ tions for free knowledge and what the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement of free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pus@@ hes to his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about her own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in prison for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court removed from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
its location and condition still remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el has played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more forward @-@ looking than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ eological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ de in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el won &apos;t finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually having one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a sample diary she wrote in 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was det@@ ained .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes place at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace us ,
that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ que &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tor@@ tured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : Director of Cor@@ ruption condem@@ ns shipping to previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine following half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants for an accident of 54 million Me@@ tics .
the money came from the public funds of Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was presented by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his return to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action .
the Center for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to address the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and shows the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the re@@ acting .
the company seemed to be silent , however , and did not indu@@ ce appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which have been s@@ unk .
he could give affordable talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped harm .
consequently , it is obvious that Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to pay for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already been so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted .
Cam@@ ba@@ za failed to return the mor@@ als and serve the state , but he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but he only served himself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ ler for an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ or@@ ah prison not only to remember the Mozambique Channel as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions also declined :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting for ten years and was free .
and today , the company , in which he rep@@ ents funds , res@@ umes it again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - ville ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dis@@ appearing conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with racism today , but the word in itself does not automatically trigger hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ its ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to reli@@ ve his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze and control the post by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to clear his posts when he only wanted to let his friends know that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I drew attention to this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to collect , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; denied the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author commented on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems that they have started this without a local context or technical support , and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not attempt to rec@@ tify the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship ensured a lot of ri@@ dic@@ ule among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now talking about Facebook and consciously writing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate language , but still have been removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bur@@ mes@@ an text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to address violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the ex@@ changing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ old age is at 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities took hold of practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ man &apos;s Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that is not the age of maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children with 15 already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media mo@@ tions , eager to aboli@@ sh laws on children &apos;s wo@@ es , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they should , to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent self contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child @-@ deer was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
after it was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s wo@@ e were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price .
while Abel Jackson of opinion was , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot; good news !
the divor@@ ce has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the change of the married life was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # tur@@ tle tur@@ tle .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook appears in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law was to be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of law , said it was quite lawful when Mahar@@ aj wants to act against the law , most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so universally , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , we would simply talk about that the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ minded men who are in the benefit of them , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children before in different levels are legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they under@@ line .

although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as outlined in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ age of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is irre@@ voc@@ able despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we were putting aside all sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when in their respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ators at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you attack another URL that is not the original . that which you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for wildlife conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I started to kne@@ el pictures immediately ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look like .
and he should know it , for he stood before Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the boy appeared . he immediately sits down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photos of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a sha@@ m and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is common among men . however , they have far fewer allocation rules to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main subject of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club .
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was of women who don &apos;t call her hus@@ bands on the name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not speaking out loud on the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are all guilty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband on behalf , wanted to try out at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion about her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video came to an end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then they all asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they do not respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they passed the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women could never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she just sat before her throughout the exercise ; another decided to release the whole set of fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ alin about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during supp@@ er in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ pos@@ al red dot on the forehead that indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
to the question of whether the five months have changed since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into play :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only made little steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including me , are doing it yet , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two men continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les official YouTube channel .
on June 29 this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively interview the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has enough to let the Japanese run through .
the people here knew quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka said , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! - Today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . more than 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the kite of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese , of course , make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base in the market , like this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! . today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going on today .
so , we hope you are here !

smooth @-@ headed men are drag@@ ged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that sli@@ pper@@ y men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of ab@@ duction of people responsible for organ trade , probably for dis@@ believers purposes , is concerned by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a smooth @-@ headed man can bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time successive attacks on sli@@ pper@@ y men have been registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission carried out in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique , men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Muslim police warned according to the latest kill@@ ings of three smooth @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ ham Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the males .
the persecution and murder of single @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably dis@@ believers rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims had power in the head , the riches of Gen@@ eri@@ ere .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I am fond of E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country where people would be embarrass@@ ed to demand sex against good grades , and do not take their lives to make their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or smooth @-@ headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala district , Pedro S@@ ange , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are sli@@ pper@@ y :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of smooth people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) has played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arabian blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who were themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials heard that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared since 2011 and the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or enforced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : notes Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was delivered to the hospital because of liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Foreign Ministry in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a speaker tells him that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway Finn@@ mark Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into effect after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government told me that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , since exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his incar@@ cer@@ ation , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision by which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions on Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA in the United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans want him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad so that he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the news agency AF@@ P announced on 27 June that the embassy demands the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Department of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can get into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns if the whi@@ rl@@ wind could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ es the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells her story :
Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those involved in the exercise of these rights .
France - France
French Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will ultimately accept it .
Taiwan ( USA )
the Council of land@@ fills in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and which he had been strictly punished for , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight from the responsibilities , a duty of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the Singapore political system with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of this , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be lik@@ ened to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the theme , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be Democrats , leave the distorted logic because it fits better to their power .
during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he disgu@@ sted appropriate questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies of rational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , as long as he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by releasing his comment on the blog , he points to the critics that one should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that is right associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a friend of Fre@@ ud@@ der ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must our prime minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
it tends to include Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home country or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series with ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked by me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in anger when they are kept for Americans , but I do not distur@@ b that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
on the other hand , Americans ... .
so it was already when I began traveling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be phi@@ list@@ - like the ben@@ ign , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian dual @-@ tran@@ sit@@ ter ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then stepped on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ ody Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band that was famous in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ dic@@ ates the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civil government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells of what regulations his girlfriend makes him .
although not explicitly political , the music video does indirectly refer to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video related to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the Supreme Commander of the Army an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change the setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often exploited by the authorities in order to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and individuals who accused the monarchy to have slan@@ dered the monarchy to prosec@@ ute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict protection against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( majority ins@@ ult ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song presented members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ sia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ den@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this area .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and they are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elder man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , can be seen on balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighbourhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ ch@@ asia for ever , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other vill@@ agers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are vac@@ ations , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do so constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s inter@@ loc@@ utor Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
despite their relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ adequ@@ acy in their lives .
they do not know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in Ted@@ dy Be@@ ar shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , tells Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy drugs they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ee beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her , because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a building worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests send her often text messages when she went to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has noticed that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
currently 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is back full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travelers consult their phones cal@@ m@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic for those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she pu@@ ff in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she presents her for a short time .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats her every time . &quot; they have gone away . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet the authorities sounded the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification of the police , the app would determine and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable government actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures , as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the media out@@ let based on Twitter ( which has been published on Twitter ) , the cens@@ ored news published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the China &quot; ( which are to be found in Germany ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the spread of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action infr@@ ing@@ es the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible default , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both from inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one who has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform themselves into beings out of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts are in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth revol@@ ves on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone have built stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough so that I could &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest , such as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters of the town sought , but mine own .
for the first time it was silent , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that has been stuff@@ ed up into the arter@@ ies with government security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down something after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice ref@@ using through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we turned to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
at such a moment you realize that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ ened all the way to the office of security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sorry to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father equally with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably shared a bigger cell with me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with just one more prisoner and can immediately put me on without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I switched back to an old tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ef@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently there was in none of the surrounding cells a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness I don &apos;t see any distinctive facial features , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be heard immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled at the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; recording on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was ventil@@ ated : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yers and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he comes to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expression that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life as you join those days and protest at demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to be accustomed to not answering .
I really can no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had nothing to do to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ately &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t keep your cri@@ es back .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four wires to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t like it at all , why he took the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he stro@@ lls to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belongs to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ a@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ental , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his home city of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that are rich in Syria from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by limits in his thinking , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluc@@ t@@ ance against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as &quot; the second generation &quot; - even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so much because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water sol@@ itary Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ wis@@ s speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the Sch@@ wa@@ den of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks into the neighbouring countries .
so one simply avoids to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry Jordan told the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former press spokesperson on the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which questioned the proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms to Lei@@ be , forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly d@@ ull unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Ehren@@ mur@@ ders &quot; - the in@@ official exterior .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still difficult to add that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the wife to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed up with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been strongly cens@@ ored up to 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to notice that his comments were torn , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why cannot Jord@@ ani@@ ans do this ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service adopted several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason they have cri@@ tically expressed comments in social media to the problems linked with the deeply rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and internal changes .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of a Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience them . &quot;
perhaps the region will conver@@ se with the aid of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streaming uni@@ tions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes that .
until it is far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many parts of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , the drums and dancing came over more than one thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ ary to the knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
it is hard to imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .

rarely external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ b and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel secure .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the contest of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts on each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric look as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in the art of hair@@ dressing , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love brief@@ e to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declaration of love for guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel em@@ powered to accommodate affection ?
this was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la @-@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bian people , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their weapons around the clock , must now re@@ integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Camp@@ aig@@ n
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more .
he continued to talk about sharing his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ art travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were on the way they had done it earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the Cam@@ bu@@ ches ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion .
the students were all raised as already war and the F@@ ARC were already in secret .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never found a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated those who were surrounded by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would prevail .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with horror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a D@@ amo@@ is compl@@ aining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published that themati@@ zed the deportation , torture and killing que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who captured suspected que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in sh@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the sex balance of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
in the last analysis they moved into the USA for fear of their lives .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the round through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me for the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it . it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good person .
I am grateful to him for having handled respect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just evil , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother got too much and she put a sn@@ are around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends verified the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering me , without proof , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are hiding . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I wish I could not overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to avoid hur@@ ting her .
when we chat with camera , I really do not give myself any effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are d@@ ull ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who took a one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so I mean , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are the gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives , to put themselves to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there to present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is it just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison were gone after their beard had grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they just took them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken along .
until now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about it yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gro@@ z@@ y , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the &quot; civili@@ sation , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the ministry of security of the Sh@@ aria never just hurt me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ice not over the mis@@ fortune of another &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one often says to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you because they believed that you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking about morality in television .
he did not speak about us per se , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city .
who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at once with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what type of activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people myself when I par@@ ap@@ per@@ ate influ@@ enza .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
so nature is , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ro@@ dents have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ sting .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re@@ marked the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ hah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have earned this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to nour@@ ish their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable usable areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little of this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime rejected the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters from the Arab territories in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have led only to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school , and 45 % had a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their hom@@ etown of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists suggest alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments before me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex still passes through the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple of it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I get to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or on the other hand , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical respect a terrible and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still exists in its name .
I prefer to dissolve myself entirely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of creating myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enormous a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm for my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life is neither passed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or a can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an area in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the flow that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country are afraid that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of their work lies on pursued , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new mul@@ timedi@@ al techniques , with the aid of supp@@ ressed congregations that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay &apos;s women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show her rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a Police Com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed suspici@@ on about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ry , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s ac@@ coun@@ table adver@@ t was not useful .
a few days later , the second wife retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are at all reimbur@@ sed at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must be reported at all by law enforcement agencies .
content 1 pun@@ ches and stati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does nothing for@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are actually mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , a researcher on gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports , but which do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the available figures are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were reported for domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were involved in violence against women .
86 % of the ads reported by the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psych@@ ic abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offen@@ se , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most frequent forms of violence against women and at the same time the hard@@ est recognizable :
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described her ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos , himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long fallen from Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner mal@@ treated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I Bel@@ ieve You &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , they received no support .
she carried out a process against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly concerned with money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paraguay Law : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but are not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country .
a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , known as # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # prince ) under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain fem@@ ini@@ ties to an independent criminal case and to punish the har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the legislative text was changed in some respects , in order to also win the MEPs for the law that were afraid that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be denied , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill was intended to cost the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that the victims of violence have to bear at present , if they simply permit and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no adequate financial means to do so :
in Paraguay mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the off@@ ence of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must pay for such a long time , until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman a year after ban on a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but later released .
Oman has been reig@@ ning since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having aboli@@ shed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , supreme commander of the armed forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s reign is marked by the insist@@ ence efforts of security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedom , including press freedom , freedom of press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , intim@@ id@@ ate and imprisoned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , concluded that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tied hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a decision in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties involve the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Management , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS picked up the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closing of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
on 26 December 2016 , al @-@ Ha@@ j acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after a six @-@ month prison sentence from prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is serving his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to re@@ mit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received personally another instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again turned against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has been injured in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the practice of printing on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Iranian authorities :
1 . free and un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research performed on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is the Director of the Central Laboratory at the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ i national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
Q : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay receiver instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
how can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the US to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been in the USA salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual varieties but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or cris@@ p@@ y leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but meanwhile it needs longer since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far for salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those features he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the U.S. and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ red@@ dish variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as if the movement comes from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit that others can use the seeds that they have cultivated .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds , to breed it , to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seed also plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified , or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; says he and takes on the ever more frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples would like to buy crops from Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it possible for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown crops such as wheat are patented in an even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or their colour improves up to those in which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders decreases by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more important than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property rights other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innov@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
so , such protection in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees this differently : wait for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , it certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait for a long time to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant breeders in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety breeds also its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed for their cultivation , cultiv@@ ates in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such which move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on also believes that breeders are becoming more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years , with which I think it is pretty easy . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet specific requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , stated that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for which the official start @-@ off will be scheduled for the next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has largely been paid to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities strongly critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the block@@ age and not to admit .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , including the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada &apos;s blog blog and human rights scientist Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt un@@ appro@@ achable websites and media .
now the blog he set up was to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada said to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blog may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , an attempted murder , pr@@ elo@@ ad on the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities locked up 133 pages from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content to which Egyptian users could access .
the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by means of which they can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day by day newspapers in whole Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ eves smoke chem@@ ist &apos;s pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violent wave reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
thus , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; , known for its detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper in such a way :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . all that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ede , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the paper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult to hold those responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has been shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for many years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to win a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . since a number of years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio is also drawing serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a Zi@@ vi@@ list is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police cl@@ ung the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
in particular , the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 , demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition , based on the United Nations &quot; investigations and other human rights organisations , assume that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , causing inhabitants to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nearby and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . their food , however , makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in homes and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for the past three years , Global Vo@@ ices has been struggling to announce this project and make it clear that it is becoming more and more &quot; more familiar . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ ni@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms derived from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee @-@ kit , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities that are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite recordings , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in only 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the event :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protest from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building appro@@ vals in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a large @-@ scale reform proposal introduced by the government for serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the building activity in case the applicant had means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val leads further in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , are spreading , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data with the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was instrumental in this fat@@ eful weekend in October so that the server did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the website counted more than half a million acc@@ esses .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the Haz@@ ara ethnic group , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Africa for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say so then she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son much longer - maybe never again .
at dawn , the boy was supposed to break .
his unc@@ le would pick it up and bring him to the tractors .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal pit for a few years . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating there . we mounted nylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous navigation on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and was str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy has a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers because of relatively high twin quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still draw for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his innocent li@@ on@@ ess helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the topic of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of the Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also designs plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
notes report : bill draft from Egypt enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
whoever fails this step could be sentenced to a penalty of up to six months or the ple@@ dge of a pen@@ al payment .
the Act , which was promoted by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced to the tough@@ er punishment for the abuse of the president or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the exposure of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposal , such a fact would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
his trial was postpon@@ ed until 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ pollution of among other things weapons @-@ ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza was acqu@@ itted by two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ rog@@ ated documents
Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben @-@ G@@ har@@ bia has been inter@@ rog@@ ated primarily to a crowded action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of law , the business@@ men and during the former regime accused by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption charges am@@ nesty as long as they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document , published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the law .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources under the name of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Council , which journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May , he was a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing news in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also stated in the regulations that the registration with the full name will be required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts assume that by eliminating the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks , it is unclear how the authorities apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the State cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the dissemination of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
this web site currently includes websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ cab@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site was closed because it was &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff
within this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
