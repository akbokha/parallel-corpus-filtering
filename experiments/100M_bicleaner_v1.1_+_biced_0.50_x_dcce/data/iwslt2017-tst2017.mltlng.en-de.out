this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone was heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA sold illeg@@ ally teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA over@@ threw Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like this chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has fought against ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whist@@ leb@@ lower and sp@@ itting journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they are revealing .
so when the government came up with tears , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters had already done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , ris@@ en lived with the risk to go to jail .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they have been saying that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of separ@@ ators and ris@@ ers to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly worried his telephone number ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whist@@ leb@@ lower during his accession , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whist@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to handle the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment they are contacting , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all .
it is up to us to make sure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to have mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the care of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a wall@@ street in@@ sider who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; were hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for a statement . &#93; this week we were sent news of a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of news , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are being used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these drums .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations about this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data spot from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is true that in some US states you need less information , need less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to gam@@ ble school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Bar firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that everyone except for a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was handed over to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to regard this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen violations of transparency what concerns owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US lag@@ s behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the transparency that enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale back .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in the bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild alien sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on to@@ e @-@ tips to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump of time , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to do so . our apartment will be a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and established so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ ov@@ el@@ ettes taste completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me started .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you come by .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we warned that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
no one who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have all learned as children that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you &apos;re contempl@@ ating the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste , which degree of trust we desired .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left neighbour .
this soft touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who now has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements , all of which say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens the confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people rely on each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bl@@ ends common things .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are spending .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; Great art@@ works in your home ! I &apos;m doing a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can one create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
with what we did not reck@@ on , the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people are entitled to our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business is just going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who celebrated un@@ lawful parties or rav@@ aged homes .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million paid nights only had a fraction ever a problem .
for people trusted each other rightly .
if trust works , something wonderful can occur .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ed blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who rescue life , even though they do not know one at all .
you go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books .
you can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled over this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now just to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people leave a part of themselves open , and this changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of residents would wait there to thoroughly re@@ plen@@ ish and show a neighborhood of which you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch to another ?
what would it look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were trained . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , night 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did it work ?
apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for the next time .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
most probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17 @-@ year old , to adapt myself to a perfect and unbe@@ atable beauty ideal .
I didn &apos;t just pas@@ sively accept the faith of my parents .
I have had the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should one do this ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; In the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bard Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to go to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I heard -- when we were silent -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be cau@@ tious in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be em@@ bal@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the middle of the week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day in which Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the comprehensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people that were held for Muslims in the open , beating and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we release them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympics .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
there may be some parking spaces free , but not stopping the terror .
regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view on people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or bed in front of a computer .
when first the person is cut off from their church , even from their families so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , it does not exagger@@ ate what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is its brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . each minister , with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that gave meaning to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to give it a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive approach to a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it look like normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows : if you submit messages to test persons , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ ells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the allocation of collective debt is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an experienced young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we opted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the Kinder@@ sitz , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , and took off my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with depth , working in a noble thought factory , that is , an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did so with the biggest study carried out on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers is just about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ package delivery entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live in front of a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , planes reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build up @-@ of @-@ your @-@ charge structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we want to show you a few of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alisation technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ cut@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , skilled pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight equipment , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ controlled flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actuators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right when I see all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
by doing so , it receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other against the clock@@ wise direction .
when one builds them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , if also restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as there is a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known throughout us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational waves .
let us classi@@ fy the events in the first place .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , millions of lives were created on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most people considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gravit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
you went through me and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
basically that was the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gravit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational @-@ wave is a c@@ row in the fabric of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stressed when the waves hit the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that is why one declared the lig@@ o employees crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than one eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite convenient , because you can make a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , in fact , impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
your child &apos;s face for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , we can reveal much about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same pen with an additional change of tone . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of motion , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- No one who knows what to hear is recognized as a noise from -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
in this there is the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o has a completely new way of exploring the universe , as it was never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as they are op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own tail light .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is probably the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , said to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes like Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the din@@ osau@@ rs for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before whom I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes &apos; .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes , which deeply changed my life , to an unexpected kind of art . it started with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ b , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I be@@ g to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I am going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; - say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things look like you &apos;re thinking about life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this season I am responsible for introducing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I don &apos;t just run around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it &apos;s true if I say it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I put troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
that &apos;s how to make a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sums .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on her .
many people assume , when I declare to them the tot@@ ality that I am talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the sums -- when I started with television production , when I started working and working , creating , creating , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such sums , then you cannot strive otherwise than by size .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size , no matter what price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sums &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it means genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more crowded limits , the more work there , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this sums . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I only this sums ?
and then the sums stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ b , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were stopped .
the bo@@ unc@@ ing of the engine was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums were not returned .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium sleeps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes whatever .
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love is suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you are doing what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one of the sums when you know the sums already when the sums are stopped , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no more than two things will become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I missed it when I am Titan and my h@@ um smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breathing , I cannot do anything except to pay attention .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pen@@ cils and the song in which it comes to letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy cher@@ ub comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sum .
and now I feel as if I know a magic secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium sum , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I have forgotten what the real sums are .
the sums are not a force , and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true hum@@ ming is dependent on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the true hum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real h@@ um is simple and original .
the true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this to a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t seem to play as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what is better for a person than to be at home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we rus@@ hed around in the garden , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you are quite right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show @-@ figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talk to me my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no cell phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children will make ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for your peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and save it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is a pity for me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the more happy I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I &apos;m creating the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the sum , the sum : the sums of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things look like , I &apos;m thinking you &apos;re living .
that is part of the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ sur@@ geons .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
they have probably heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s suffering from violent trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas sw@@ ells the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life one has to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove part of a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw this under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide themselves very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we par@@ ted them to the est@@ ran@@ gement of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we took the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ en@@ rolled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ fut@@ ed .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , in the motor Cor@@ tex we injured the hand motor area .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen to humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we par@@ ted the cells : the same monkey , two months after mat@@ ing .
I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one has to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant that it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v or the Communist Party of China , or some of my lovely friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are crushed , our future is ble@@ ak , and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin Summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few realize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and in@@ comes income with which one could pay the debt berg and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchanges and raising the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low general economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , boo@@ sts the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , in fear , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ der with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
its extremely wast@@ eful kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these conclusions .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that it appe@@ aled to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vote in questions of state power .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , while the economy gradually under@@ rated politics and em@@ powered them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like that before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power , because the government has moved away from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , which sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it eats , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste raised , and the social conflicts lower , just as it is - already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and pay attention to the fact that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ nosis that makes the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and put people in their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ good utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of the company : ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to another , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction more between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not owned by the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no elev@@ ating twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely oscill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that you didn &apos;t have the technical means at that time .
today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which it pre@@ fers privileged individuals , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as Liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am perfectly whi@@ r@@ ling .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t talk about it , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you keep from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where the most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some respects , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , sm@@ ells tremendous for hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start with the euro@@ zone a new beginning ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the persistent den@@ ial that a massive recycling line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues , which mas@@ sively threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
it is right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to elect den@@ ial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if we try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such an ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ ors &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s Troika who imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 that appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of the Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is chief manager at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the valuation allocation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after having looked at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle de@@ ple@@ tion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where everyone can watch for free .
and if Amazon issue things out for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again .
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went into a car and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
we have two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data for a decision you can make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of stati@@ stic than back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we are living in a time when we are more and more dealing with statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way , by data analysis of the Google research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data streams down in decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use a lot of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dissemin@@ ated .
if you ever need to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the single parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it all : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data say to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or No @-@ Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will do it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit more wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
