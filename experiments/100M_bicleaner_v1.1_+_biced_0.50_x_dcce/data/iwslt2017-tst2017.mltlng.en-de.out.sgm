<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone was heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA sold illegally telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA overthrew Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like this chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has fought against risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spitting journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government came up with tears, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, risen lived with the risk to go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been saying that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separators and risers to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly worried his telephone number,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit return, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower during his accession, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which should be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment they are contacting, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet existed when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is up to us to make sure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to have misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abnormalities in the care of soldiers and report about crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who strikes the alarm for the contaminated water from Flint. or a wallstreet insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] [enormous sums of money] were hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for a statement.] this week we were sent news of a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of news, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are being used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these drums.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is going on." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have been no prominent Americans in these revelations about this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data spot from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is true that in some US states you need less information, need less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to gamble school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 Bar firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone except for a lawyer made proposals to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was handed over to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to regard this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single leading politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforting as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen violations of transparency what concerns owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US lags behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the transparency that enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale back.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "How to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in the bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I rock?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on toe-tips to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump of time, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something to do so. our apartment will be a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and established so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese-ham-ovelettes taste completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and me started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website that people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We warned that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in consolation would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have all learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you're contemplating the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste, which degree of trust we desired.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who now has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please Twitter that he is candidate for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements, all of which say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens the confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people rely on each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the people who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation blends common things.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are spending.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, e.g. "Great artworks in your home! I'm doing a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can one create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not reckon, the great multitude of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people are entitled to our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unlawful parties or ravaged homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million paid nights only had a fraction ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, something wonderful can occur.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even sped blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who rescue life, even though they do not know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay does not expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled over this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now just to call" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not just true." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People leave a part of themselves open, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group of residents would wait there to thoroughly replenish and show a neighborhood of which you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch to another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would it look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children were trained. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, night 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Most probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carchtegern-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as a 17-year old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unbeatable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have had the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces free, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular attendance of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view on people of other faiths, and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first the person is cut off from their church, even from their families so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one looks at them, it does not exaggerate what they" "" "read" "" "in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is its brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. each minister, with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that gave meaning to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised to give it a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive approach to a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it look like normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you submit messages to test persons, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood swells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Basters is just about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-package delivery entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France live in front of a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, planes reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-of-your-charge structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localisation technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgecutters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight equipment, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-controlled flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right when I see all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in pleasure, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">By doing so, it receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise direction.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, if also restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a palette of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as there is a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known throughout us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify the events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, millions of lives were created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-interferometer- gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo could be substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through me and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically that was the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their through observatories as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a crow in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers often perform a really silly dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stressed when the waves hit the waves. the elongation of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that is why one declared the ligo employees crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are tremendous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient, because you can make a picture or a map of things by using the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, in fact, impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, Alice speaks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, we can reveal much about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same pen with an additional change of tone. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- No one who knows what to hear is recognized as a noise from -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo has a completely new way of exploring the universe, as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as they are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is obscured by its own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, said to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes like Ligo observes them are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the dinosaurs for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year, I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "before whom I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say yes'.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes," "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which deeply changed my life, to an unexpected kind of art. it started with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "bikers" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "bib, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I beg to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I am going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" - say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things look like you're thinking about life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this season I am responsible for introducing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work so that you understand that I don't just run around on the computer and fancier, and it's true if I say it's not about dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I put troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">That's how to make a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, when I declare to them the totality that I am talking about writing that writing gives me pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started with television production, when I started working and working, creating, creating, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such sums, then you cannot strive otherwise than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">"" "this is called" "" "sums" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it means genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more crowded limits, the more work there, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "bib, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The bouncing of the engine was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums were not returned.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love is suddenly faded away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "howl, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you are doing what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one of the sums when you know the sums already when the sums are stopped, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says:" "" "mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no more than two things will become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "bib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it calls no one more" "" "bible" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I missed it when I am Titan and my hum smokes, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, loneliness and lack of breathing, I cannot do anything except to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax pencils and the song in which it comes to letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy cherub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium sum, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I have forgotten what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force, and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True humming is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The true humming ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real hum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "I do this to a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic." ""</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't seem to play as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what is better for a person than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rushed around in the garden, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are quite right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet-show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talk to me my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children will make ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is to feel the humming, to have a place for your peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the sums are not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is a pity for me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays travel to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more happy I and my children.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeons.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have probably heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." one implanted an electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's suffering from violent tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain traumas swells the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life one has to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove part of a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide themselves very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we parted them to the estrangement of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-plan these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we took the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-enrolled exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been refuted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, in the motor Cortex we injured the hand motor area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recuperate to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we parted the cells: the same monkey, two months after mating.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one has to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms in order to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patient to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yev from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yv or the Communist Party of China, or some of my lovely friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are crushed, our future is bleak, and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few realize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and incomes income with which one could pay the debt berg and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchanges and raising the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low general economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, boosts the pessimism of investors who, in fear, the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causing the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hader with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athenical democracy was and is that it appealed to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they gave them the right to political co-determination with equal vote in questions of state power.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, while the economy gradually underrated politics and empowered them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like that before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power, because the government has moved away from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators, which sustainably decimated the animals from which it eats, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism sells the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste raised, and the social conflicts lower, just as it is - already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to reunite the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and pay attention to the fact that we democratize the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hypnosis that makes the film" "" "Matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," in which machines serve human beings and put people in their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -good utopia instead of the "Matrix" similar dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: ask a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not owned by the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no elevating twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely oscillating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that you didn't have the technical means at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged individuals, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as Libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... Do we not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am perfectly whirling.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't talk about it, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you keep from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where the most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I can say so provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells tremendous for hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Greek finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the persistent denial that a massive recycling line went through the eurozone, and continues, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to elect denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If we try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive by political will and authoritarianism, it may be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such an tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the donors' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that passed through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's Troika who imposed on us this policy was:" "" "this was a colossal error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930 that appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of the Europeans and the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is chief manager at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation allocation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where, after having looked at a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to underline "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle depletion, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where everyone can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon issue things out for nothing, you get too, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skipping or watching again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went into a car and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">We have two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data for a decision you can make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistic than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, this is somewhat frightening because we are living in a time when we are more and more dealing with statistics to make serious choices, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of influenza, the bad way, by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year around year, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data streams down in decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginably use a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the single parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data say to us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at that moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will do it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit more wiser than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
