Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows , who had to get upset , because the car @-@ nav@@ i was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but that is why they are very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a tile carpet which one does not recognize alike .
in the large picture map , detailed maps , so @-@ called urine he@@ ets , have been incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were developed according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map were :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the datas@@ he@@ et for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek ( Bavarian State Library ) .
the comparison between early and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was found 21 years after the map was created , in 18@@ 77 , as Munich &apos;s district .
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ in @-@ hand numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ absorption &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots give no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded on the Au@@ er Lü@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought into connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example buying the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later extended to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich on the grounds of the former institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football field of TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in architec@@ turally reminiscent of the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ strasse was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bom@@ b@@ ings broke many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 will take place the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a series of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and can be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , and the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have bre@@ aches of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear ail@@ ments in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he no longer had any petrol during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Assembly , showing that the fact that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring about buying money or know the relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime program that classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial pro@@ filed .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US .
fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ discre@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Group Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have taken a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fischer@@ bacher CD@@ U village association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs at the Rec@@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young mamm@@ als supplied and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Regi@@ on@@ ales only come to the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep surfaces .
the green area care for much work , much must be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ sers , even if it does not lead to bio@@ activity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they will continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism because of the support .
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by the electric fence .
the surface area is 40 hectares , which can not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 500 the half was funded by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmer had 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Care Center ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a flow rate specified by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the en@@ closures should not be in@@ effective ( slope inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 Fischer@@ bacher fence project , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the open space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated conflict with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took on its meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the fur@@ ious words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , your oppressed masses , who desire to breathe freely , and the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words on the basis for their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ante .
the combination of poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not charging anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame to the re@@ mor@@ ed world : &quot; Lady Liberty proceeds .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , el@@ ting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever like to acknowledge .
their torch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; Director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics track , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is something special in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black says .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally included were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ range runner Mu@@ ir goes on this way and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another fleet to watch for a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of her coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Po@@ dia .
concerning my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the hot @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ ap@@ ed at the criticism , safe .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we will be led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very a@@ dep@@ t to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy at his side .
hence the blocking of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post office and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not crowded , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t really appreciate this idea if a number of people have a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than such a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees called as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials or arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last updated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mail @-@ writers struck on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ powered his office , according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
free speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance is to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player home to South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magic .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; Or@@ r said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how much time has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades less and less people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates there are 167 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year in Germany due to passive smoking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the director of the building yard Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much snow in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which constantly hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction group of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and shut @-@ off guards is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and the buses are only allowed for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands is extracted and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water out of the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is o@@ ily . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ u@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted from rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
only very few Indonesian have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans addressed a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ é .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her alive , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has broken down gold and copper worth 3.1 billion dollars .
in addition , Papua has wooden resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ ian calls for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &apos;s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have strengthened , because Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing because Muslim migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are fighting for help here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Papua , Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the altogether 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua people have changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have been broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , said the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ i@@ ti@@ sing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started tow@@ ing stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ fourth of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indonesian , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure their station &quot; only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism to settle historic human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independent vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was hit by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal community Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many included the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ u@@ ire Airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on international media coverage remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although their rare permission was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy head of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , natives broke their silence and urged him to &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua people , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who named his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 am local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises throughout the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior pan@@ eling for decoration or isolation came .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his big Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup one on two sets was not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ sentence classics , which are often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ sentence classics , are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
even before the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to finish the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to perform less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey conducted by passengers flow@@ ed by more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally carrying out prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they were late discovered that they had traveled er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 people - operated by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of the mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were .
the most common items that were deliberately passing by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent reported to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it had sur@@ vey@@ ed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally smu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought about airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who were most frequent .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far been subject to the fact that a portion of the customers has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less brilliant number for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly assessment : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , sp@@ aci@@ fied mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 - all models are to be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , a million 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of the year 2018 - when Tes@@ la is creating his brand new production lines tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there are more delays , then the un@@ binding reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in flocks .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the hes@@ itation of Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been su@@ ed from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environment Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of governmental environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Labour Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deadline which ran off on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of o@@ zone in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed by O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment as President Donald Tru@@ mp , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay the regulation of the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Labour Court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not respect the deadlines for conducting and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who charged the EPA over a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet the EPA statement said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powers to ensure that the rules are based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress press on a more comprehensive re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at a minimum of eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had filed the EPA in this week , said the Group intends to uph@@ old legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York included California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when contam@@ in@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s surprising course of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether it is an idyllic location and a beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius system is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer judgments : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen along with the bird ab@@ bey &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , besides the former parish church , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was one and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , there was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the noble settlement core of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 support these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit that church .
thus the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two collap@@ sed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell units were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to pl@@ unge in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ bau@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night of 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler High School Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local President Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of great importance for tum@@ bling and hearing welding .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to homeland care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini confirms .
association wants to check permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind @-@ force concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ agus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the town of Vier@@ sen had agreed a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mal@@ function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirements , the granted authorisation letter is still un@@ lawful and therefore rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; appro@@ ving the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind energy plants is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to test the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to current proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in regards to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , concluded lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this equ@@ ates to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ day households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , four @-@ year @-@ old town council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident

a woman was injured and injured .
two more people were injured slightly .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car was driving the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person .
city and traders plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre .
as the chairman of the industrial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers who offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
domestic firms should also present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the action aims not only for residents of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest including Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city center while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to help revi@@ ve the inner city - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which in part spread , had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , five Thurin@@ gian cities , took part for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchase behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after an explosion at the US school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
two people were killed and nine others were injured in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , some of them severely injured .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a cause of dis@@ mis@@ sal , the authorities suspected works on a gas line .
only a few people stayed in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
Tru@@ mp replaced the crowded tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tru@@ mp called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly declare that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president accused him of publicly den@@ ounc@@ ing the wall . according to reports he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was medi@@ ated by the Obama government would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp finished the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ores Ford massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and glan@@ cing at the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get it out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cri@@ es t@@ ore the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone sounded very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens &apos; rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge in order to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were as@@ yn@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of the provision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the position serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe Community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays a sheet on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding Gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but none of them was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens &apos; rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch &apos;s actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ah according to information of the FB@@ I of the black colour guard Roger Mal@@ com settled a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between national and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ tering the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de .
their representation is clear , gri@@ pping , and is based in a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room were actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es out and pus@@ hes it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , wa@@ ving from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors was swe@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy moves in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship sub@@ stitutes the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once more .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman wearing a dream dress is about the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos;s mour@@ ning hymn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
during a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys , Broo@@ ks have experienced all the almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s name .
children ho@@ ck on their heads , record the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then thro@@ ws together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance breaks down with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ted about the after@@ math of a black couple , whom they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feeling the performance left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is only called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks sits at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he had already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf uses a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the rotating stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows alternatively a sh@@ ady street corner with the wall rest and the D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine bo@@ ilers pose as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
st@@ acked oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - Money , Power and Gi@@ ving - that moves through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine bo@@ ilers - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ i@@ ously harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a cor@@ p@@ se in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully fi@@ esen Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a gravity box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) will have to believe in it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
in stor@@ my days Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated , who mo@@ urn and bend his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the gig was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ utter of whist@@ ling for himself , five years later , there was great jubil@@ ation in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should be pleased about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of his view has grown .
I draw a positive summary .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year right in several places .
where everywhere ?
crowd : normally in the furniture market in St@@ einf@@ urt , once a week I am here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked on the school already in an open full day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon support .
for me it was just the right thing that provoked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
unlike in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about counting st@@ atics .
there are still other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond to it individually .
very interesting .
and you did not have reservations ?
amount : I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut off another 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job reductions , announced by General Director John Fall@@ on at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will additionally result in previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs were already lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after the first half of the year achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ vo@@ y attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , divided a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated at the Bag@@ ram airport in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is weighing up the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and especially the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environment Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency because of stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they are showing the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and to respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to establish where inc@@ isions have to be made in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental policies imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , who are worried about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ation of air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for example asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal association wants common room
at the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ ner decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly it will take some time until the area belonging to the church is owned by the church community , but there is now no plan of planning for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are floating in front of such a common room not to be seen as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean community , but openly in the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision adopted by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the past autumn , by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal is to indicate to the investor that in this respect no Kn@@ üpp@@ el wants to be thrown between the legs , the statement that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the ceiling roof - which reduces the height and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he happens to the body .
not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which one is not so well advanced , but now they rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees a cover@@ t payout to anyway property or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I receive a real , in case of doubt a market@@ able equivalent , is the counter @-@ speech .
the State &apos;s request to pay the proposal accordingly , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two counter@@ parts in the original program Stefan H@@ aller puts together : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown onto road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path from the road Schwar@@ zer Weg towards Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , travelling in the same direction , gives priority to him .
when the landing field drove on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old hel@@ per .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with a ret@@ ouch car .
FC Bayern München must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without it : David Al@@ aba has to take the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , staff recru@@ its at the German Football World Cup in Munich will always be larger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must do without the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this confirmed the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ ausen Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the corpor@@ al state and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights will captiv@@ ate the fans .
the game was sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hiking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is planning the observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many har@@ go@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
domestic demand came from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of a site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , even though it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation the star is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt , since 2003 , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ es up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune of tracks ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to d@@ warf @-@ planets degra@@ ded Plu@@ to - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth thus shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measuring 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light is needed from the sun to the Plu@@ to approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix , however , would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ beaten World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas re@@ marked that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weigh@@ ted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pounds debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed the challenge of fighting for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he likes Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks of River@@ side &apos;s three combat champion &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show strength , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injuries to tire plat@@ e@@ zer
during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost control over his vehicle shortly before the junction in front of the market width .
the passenger moved to the right into the slopes , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked for about an hour in the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Drei@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Br@@ uns@@ wick that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result , wouldn &apos;t they have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three chain is also to be optimized further .
and one gate after a free@@ will , the For@@ tun@@ ers don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so that no one stands on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to deal better even after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the qu@@ ad chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , but that we harmon@@ ize even better and we do not afford so many ab@@ duc@@ tions in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can speak after a draw from a bad start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I first judged the season after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be a bit fres@@ her , as they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favourite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una inner defence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are considered to be a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum seek@@ ers
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started conducting the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some of the refugees who were inferior .
up to date , migration shortage has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , she stated that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , with the x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were used sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges on the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a concrete part of the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the department of road construction and transport in the government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three refur@@ bish@@ ment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be observed .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a wooden arch bridge covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a border attachment , which is also used as operating mode .
on Friday a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by leaf@@ lets about the project .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building farm and the bus station towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three brid@@ ging stations are 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties represented in the chal@@ k @-@ day of volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle in R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the election of the Bundestag on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but rather demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel stays colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ale - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , the chairman of the forum A world and one of the most important organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pe reports about the Af@@ D volcanic Eifel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ President Uwe Boy .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak their speeches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than an hour lasts the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can withdraw - no special events .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folk &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have won solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo band of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both are united by the desire to not only transc@@ end borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games ming@@ le with a fascinating total artistic work .
this key piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally worked out bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin affir@@ ms the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I got . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed seriously about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered as she dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to settle in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider me to be ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like being able to justify myself from the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave a statement in which it said : &quot; the change of party by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party , which would hin@@ der us rather than work to make our country magnificent again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the few legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without a leadership and is unable to find a positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of the Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be re @-@ included in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin spoke during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the ban@@ ishment of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been caught gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the rigorous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ election .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , said Re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
ob@@ itu@@ ary for soldiers crashed in Mali
at a funeral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers had thought about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister for Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to be un@@ explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two conver@@ ging pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ ns of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral took place in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the German inspec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ eker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sad@@ dens put down ro@@ ses , and the relatives were in arms in the arm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not show Le@@ yen of the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want to be a grave beside his wife
the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that was what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further said in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a feel that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he had become a king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired as well as the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princ@@ ely Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies with the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik spoke about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is due to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of parliament , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , he spoke for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis before the surprise of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony .
five months before the official date of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short@@ coming one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his Group to recommend them to include them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Grün@@ e 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is elected regularly on January 14 , 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag as soon as possible decides its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further course on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament draws confidence and chooses a successor to the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all issues in peace if they are legally reasonably tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a suppor@@ ter of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we assume that they have returned their country trade , which they received from the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extra@@ ordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly select the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and in their fru@@ stration faces their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U president , Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to incorporate El@@ ke T@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader in the German Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal care@@ gi@@ vers .
the CD@@ U was at that time before the SPD , the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the country tag .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed parts , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge exactly and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we know at the moment , a health hazard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the affected people of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessments are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and health @-@ safe .
if the residual level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants no direct guilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too little controllers in the case of an emergency .
is it missing only on staff or on conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 per cent .
this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be found are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ arms really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ ted means that manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
it is important to work on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues of European football associations will not interfere with N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will happen for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must sometime prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can safely make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign it and bring it to a galax@@ y of other stars , given the funding of the team through the vast power of Qatar &apos;s wealthy family .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must be controlled with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves when banks or owners drew back their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from focusing on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A sequ@@ el Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to reduce excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the N@@ ey@@ mar buy @-@ out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ list their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
that was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the World Cup Organ@@ izing Committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup messengers will be identified and such maneu@@ ver could be easy for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales after the signing will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the funding of the fair , because you can find different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gy supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet collaboration is at the end of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request by the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white wrapped up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers .
Swiss do not want to provide information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a g@@ og@@ gy manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
as many applicants do in the new tender , Swiss does not want to reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a position .
chocolate panels distribute Swiss Life on board their flights since 2006 .
before Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s subsidiary , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo led Swiss to the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y two and a half years ago .
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of First Class are spoiled with delicacies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repetition of history is no@@ stal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter filmed the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as Franchise it feels like the time is short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a nice jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
playing at the core of the gig - actors aged middle @-@ aged play hor@@ ny kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ ody leaves more according to the principle of casting , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that sh@@ ook the cra@@ dle ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ ist , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil P@@ lot , in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good feeling of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ et of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieved what I suppose as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ east@@ ward @-@ west ring combat icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning &apos;s Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it &apos;s gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can make everything to feed .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , as the prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance communicated on Friday .
15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 years of age and have already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed in total .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office has been conducting Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in the southern German region .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the great use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the focus of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als with regard to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
fashion compl@@ ains major gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a large number of gaps in the register of foreigners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign country authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been adequately maintained , data quality in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can slow return processes considerably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also captured who don &apos;t have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this goes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper therefore means that BA@@ MF conduc@@ ts such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees to the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the Left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now divided 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations meanwhile .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation hon@@ ors the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out and we will respect the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the district manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserves are divided into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , ma@@ ize makers reported of the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the switch to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
as early as before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 awarded blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it indicated that in the next few years , interest rates would be needed to grow the inflation that was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it has been expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system , with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC GDP remains weak , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently predic@@ ting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after this news .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate increase and GDP has increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly against the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and marginal sal@@ aries , as the sharpen@@ ing will first get worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August after the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the ab@@ y@@ ss .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation boo@@ sted the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ink , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als exp@@ ire and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a fight against High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year &apos;s judgment of the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) called it a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified that agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatments .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study is intended to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , which is widely used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this major new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , aimed specifically on needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the prec@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to an end to the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , res@@ ig@@ ned in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ taken .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Storage and an mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ lap so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative in order to solve the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work for longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter @-@ important so that when you push the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which will help create emotional ties in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and elevated square meter by some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court in order to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family established jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial file states that Col@@ in owns a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brothers now also struggle for the control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but raises Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered via SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to dress our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and I would end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new head of staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the President .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed for an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election campaigns , consists in ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets would not have included any more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his associates were able to keep him out of trouble a few times , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp stuff that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of advis@@ ors to give the President doubt@@ ful information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative media cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone malicious hosts a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet Pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be &quot; le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe are sending ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after de@@ bur@@ gl@@ ers are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many cur@@ ri@@ ties were hiding on holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ omy , which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online den@@ si@@ ties have so far been arrested , at least 11 of them due to evidence after publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords in the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on war @-@ feet , that have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the congregation to rec@@ laim a field in front of their stat@@ ely homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have afflicted the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May there , were moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding lengthy brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ fu@@ eled camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to check when we place our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
made of Birken@@ hof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 approximately 30,000 nights were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collective housing , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed at the municipal council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otel with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building @-@ shuttle containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are undertaken .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful citizenship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room are among the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , emphasizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
he has already conducted conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just below a million euros , he counts .
the outer systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be open to the restaurant , which is open .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the body has recorded the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on familiar people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensified his investigations .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin for some time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 Pres@@ idential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller was investigating whether there was agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ors to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s private and business environment under the microscope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp was in the centre of the affairs and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to prove this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called anch@@ ors .
most of the time , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons to the company under oath .
according to the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations had already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also discussed the conversation .
legal experts told on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure showed that Mu@@ eller would not be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the introduction of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is responsible for all measures that accelerated the work of the special bro@@ ker in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I leader , James Com@@ ey , said three times not to be determined against the President .
one has no reason to accept that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey fired .
because of this ra@@ fts , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up the investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation as to whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair and the later rec@@ alled President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the overthrow of the President of the Justice Department .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be released as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin by the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion metric ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice col@@ ds that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to man from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
however , there have been a series of unusual colli@@ sions in the region for about 30 years , and the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) has been in a fac@@ et background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now demoli@@ shed col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Sch@@ el@@ hol@@ s swi@@ ms over the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
in the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ uses was disturbed several years ago .
a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is dis@@ car@@ ded there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is at present .
in addition , the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken off at a key point .
the melting of shell@@ fish and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level , since they float on the water and press ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes for the observation of the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is the fourth @-@ biggest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
it regularly breaks down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e will grow back or go back long and possibly collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers fail to bring back the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many c@@ ud@@ dly sn@@ u@@ ff@@ les of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen in the past few decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends to South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees in the past 50 years and there@@ with vis@@ it@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls out to step out of the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration have perme@@ ated in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips at the circle are apparently very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , there is still a lack of personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied positions in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are looked for .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements to skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application scar@@ city , it is said .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and involve a training campaign , request CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to disease or age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest time to act is therefore not to remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he was already in the chal@@ k of a fist @-@ thick surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and was ast@@ o@@ unding the rest of the parties .
nations want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay more attention to the employees and officials , as it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money exist only if one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone on NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; Jugend Save &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express in full alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that his crew takes ding@@ hy migrants on board , which are delivered directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting was supposed to have held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to be over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have on board , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived at the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine hamlet be@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers , the &quot; Berliner exterior post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy the tri@@ als and attractions for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to St. Michael &apos;s chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long Tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were told again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ lets brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers receive healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation .
also Neustadt was headed .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - met .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gears up for E @-@ Sport
do the sport stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being swe@@ at@@ y with wind and weather over the stadium race ?
fact ist : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tour@@ neys including high gau@@ ges including .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first German federal associations , who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are many clubs going up on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Federation &apos;s FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , for example , qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the former coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than once a year to send the Federal lig@@ ament to Asia .
what is it all about ?
during e @-@ sports , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup FIFA are on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long been established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and e @-@ sports is already part of the official program at the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is safe getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ itte Player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports fail .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
the players are internationally on the way , which is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study of the corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the rapid growth of e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million Euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million .
this is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on their way to the world .
major markets are Asia and the US , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league associations according to D@@ utt have meanwhile been obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison Germany is lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to decay only in no@@ stal@@ gia and to clear the old days is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything stays as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter guilty of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy urge for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced on June 13 , 2014 due to negli@@ gent killing by Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is dis@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she took no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn the generator into and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by some press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British resident in Italy , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning about the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
something else was different on its place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ e immediately , even though the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also interpret me in such a way .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f existing for youth players , de@@ but@@ s and just from vacation .
the best way to distribute sugar is to those whom you want to keep in your mood .
those who have been chosen to explore the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ cked over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right , that is now his position , the white bond on his arm did her rest .
and at all Kim@@ ly worked in this start @-@ up like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ accompanied tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy themselves .
V@@ idal so that his missing fitness has to be over@@ done ( hardly folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , to start the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , also Sü@@ le tried to succeed in the game @-@ building a few times successfully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one could see in the connection to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ ball@@ ad recently reported on Twitter before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Schn@@ ader@@ beck and with our Lad@@ ys .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Grün@@ e ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economics Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V inquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes to establish a planning process , until 2021 is to be entitled to construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West Bank of Trier , which is in the im@@ penet@@ r@@ able demand of the Federal Republic of Transport .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Mini@@ steri@@ um spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks , as inspired by bis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Cra@@ fts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the compound master examination and 2500 euros if graduates make their own self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are quick to create , at the same time it is out of place to the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Bell , chief executive of the Chamber of Industry of the Chamber of Commerce Trier .
from 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing at state @-@ run mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be issued to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of country roads as proposed .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as to how it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is the current broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the score 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Party left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of dis@@ agreement , she had already cleared the field .
Audi is to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be able to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chairman said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving constraints &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ backs .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s mistakes , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested by Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system in order to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated in the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could burden Volkswagen heavily : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft passes through Munich on Saturday &apos;s Saturday , which has a special message .
if it goes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction reference wants to elu@@ ci@@ date .
you can see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent on the raft .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True love &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen the protection of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a more consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of Car@@ to@@ on &apos;s most published carto@@ ons , the characters of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself among other things as a character for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris ended the breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again , the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table , working nearly ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread much more widespread throughout the world .
for six years , he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings , which has a thousand @-@ feet as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by it .
this is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , will be produced without saying .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of dro@@ ught and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an impact on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small brick , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ones , and with very dry weather , there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval Festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries or a country national camp should be in the city center these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leaving them at home .
security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are sufficient .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under German protection for attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ separ@@ able and even though the terrain is still more pu@@ zz@@ ling .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all di@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but there is practically no silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as rival fac@@ tions are struggling to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of adorned , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was bl@@ amed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security , after conf@@ isc@@ ating another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the poison of drugs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place .
re@@ porters loved it to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you are referring to as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the sp@@ awn @-@ bird , who could cur@@ l like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who gener@@ ously was with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , said the publisher of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing is going on with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself designated as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has been li@@ cking on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one where a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , the readers considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went in the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have grown lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and put them around because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be sub@@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an equally valid society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that put together the organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; media group has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to include the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking is frigh@@ tening him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ ck .
a number of shooting found@@ ries with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the beach of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a number of Kartell em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the edge of the board they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they had fear at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid their enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find out that his fl@@ aming skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ ar@@ ded din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ si@@ ans living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground @-@ cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature was seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have discovered that this plant e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing shell , probably was threatened by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as counter @-@ curing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ad@@ owing , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted from enough pressure by eating meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dose @-@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the beast in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes in order to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and was driven into the sea , where he sank at the back to the se@@ abed .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ er@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he &apos;s on bed . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine close to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the du@@ sty @-@ covered din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
on average , the creatures weigh@@ ed about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the under@@ cover of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the c@@ logged remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hol@@ lowed arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a win in the lotto .
the more I look , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upward .
I can count the scales on its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometers @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured at the Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) motorway on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , at 17 o &apos;clock there were almost 30 vehicles between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , including probably trucks .
at first there are no information on the exact number of the injured .
it was mild to moderate injuries , said a police officer .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the city of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre @-@ long retreat was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it was also on the counter @-@ tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive obstruc@@ tions - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of the vehicle electri@@ cians , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ches .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you are sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened into his work and just has an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buffer .
if the conductor comes and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the mer@@ cil@@ ess ticket inspection .
it is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will likely be available in many other remote routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the ticket de@@ valuation without creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to buy an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
you also have to have bought it via the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works in such a way : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
if the train atten@@ dant comes to Platz Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so you can sleep , work , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train companion staff simply check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to person@@ alize their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who travels often knows that in addition to delays and missed trains , the travel card controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often , however , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ osis Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after arriving in New York City , the one sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ un@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her mobile phone to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , assured another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected to a local regi@@ stran@@ t who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their votes and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt &apos;s occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people there must be certain vulner@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is actually maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they have not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has been spl@@ itting the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves any cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the issue is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the Bit @-@ Gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery runs more customers into the city , including the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the property where the market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the opportunity to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping almost weekly for many years in the market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ ladies always very much again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing should settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shop shops are empty - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger firms , as the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what remains of it will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the market hall supposed to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost @-@ bit gallery manage to distribute all stores from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and a shopping center that stands empty needs no one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , that resem@@ ble themselves almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and Haar@@ sections , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where former secret service analy@@ st consolidated a 35 @-@ year sentence after making public diplomatic reports about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and pioneering dis@@ sident , whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but spoke openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits clearly on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became too un@@ equal , inter@@ changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic book illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ ate would transform his judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the governmental camp and against trans@@ gender forces in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further fl@@ ames the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name has a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic nov@@ els mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she di@@ ps with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary teams like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put up your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which join together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the spot and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them have now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair conducted by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he insist@@ ently insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a mysterious tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team has published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian deputy director Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has established an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ USA@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company to not become the next user
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , to offer special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial engineering website of Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the Con@@ ver@@ cent company employs , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice - more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will support the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only applications .
the employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices are heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more obliged to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can achieve returns if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
indeed , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why I should ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ in @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three courses of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully @-@ packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change in control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , that will be a protective grid behind a door@@ posts , will not be an easy task .
bru@@ ck players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjust there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit detection by third parties and display their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and to send them to factor audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they do not succeed in eliminating hat@@ eful posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact @-@ reviewed parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related articles &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have rated my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , examining the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 , when the last heir Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started taking care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards that represent who had what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boys , let everything go their way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are joined together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote revenue . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mer@@ ma@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ alled by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle hides in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , it will be the highlight of the campaign to celebrate a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we , as a Bad Honnef citizen , are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in competition with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five @-@ digit amount and cost the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pension measures and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the general staff building , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the Pres@@ idency of the Government , the five Vice @-@ Defence Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the General Staff of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air@@ strips and the nav@@ y were aboli@@ shed .
since the failed coup , President Erd@@ og@@ an has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als 169 .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire educ@@ ator of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were to be directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had described the overthrow of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an have the army really under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the veil ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the major in the army and the security forces at any rate continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erd@@ og@@ an issued a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 national servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the real masters of the country .
three times they appl@@ au@@ ded their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an pushed the power of the military step by step , not least in his appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an is targeted specifically by Islam@@ ising the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a specially @-@ named officer who sought asylum after the attempted put@@ sch from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness to use the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the US the way the citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate road for race shuttle
again and again over the past few months , the future of the race @-@ gate sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is to go very fast .
still before the end of the year it is said to be built on the ailing course on which the tourist track drives .
in order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction work will begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained traffic state secretary Klaus atonement on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was approximately 2.5 million Euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , on which the Shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently fin@@ alised , declared at@@ oning .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian railway as operator are already agreed on technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said atonement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing @-@ boo@@ ster Shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection between the Il@@ men@@ au railway stations and the Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them in the future .
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he released his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sc@@ exp@@ u@@ gs have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more wor@@ rying as many robots possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sli@@ pping dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ sh@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ sh@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , it also has its mo@@ ods - like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the attacks on rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will naturally not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R sees their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ thered to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the sli@@ pped body and the exhibited eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots do not represent real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no placement or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the phrases of 2017 : maid girls
tru@@ mp great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp relatives .
we are all allegedly committed to burst our filter bubbles .
less notice has been the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s to bring together families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same side .
in order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is related to me in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the saving effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cru@@ el@@ ly possibility that his bi@@ kers will no longer rep@@ el us of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can of the Right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself falling from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp are indeed a very mild criminal offen@@ se .
when Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ous@@ el , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cycli@@ cal music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards .
on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to compare the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say it is too toler@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .

as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters of the F@@ uses and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , under the leadership of S@@ ophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch away from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken @-@ pu@@ ffer , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him smote the eagle , and stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young @-@ animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ year sler that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps at school bott@@ len@@ ecks and the par@@ ental representatives .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over , explained class teacher S@@ ophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she will not leave her students very reluc@@ tant , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door sler .
finally , all students en@@ rolled a song of summer@@ time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ che@@ aters have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of Euro 5 emissions categories and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation over the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to any person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in the context of the inspection .
how long will the retro@@ fit go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
it depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE reveals for waiting .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ tract , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE feared that .
but just in the regions where driving pro@@ hibitions threat@@ ens .
in rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel until now .
the ACE advised to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to be one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host and take part in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tru@@ mp to make it clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , is going to reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - suitable candidates are , however , ra@@ r .
for 31 years , W@@ acker is Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it surprised him that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time .
this should be enough time for a revision in compliance with the regular notice deadlines .
since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as a sub @-@ construction law agency , the applicant must submit relevant certificates .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can no longer fill them out , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity of the town and the city is important , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot approximately are dri@@ fted .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is provided for a city building master of great scope .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own farm and garden shop , it can be very flexibly re@@ acted to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; keep an eye on what &apos;s going on , &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the sh@@ ed@@ ding city master builder .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears great responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of experience in the field of care and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information about the city of Has@@ lach , you should have completed your studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor &apos;s degree with speci@@ alisation architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt is subject to civil and civil engineering , planning of construction , grave yard affairs , administration of urban properties , municipal courtyard with a building yard and municipal garden , as well as Lower construction rights agency including listed monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : road locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetr@@ ators and are looking for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary roller and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and end@@ anger the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay and the costs for rail replacement , P@@ ön@@ alen can also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , to go out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be managed without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning , two of which concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not come out , but they had delays .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch some 200 meters of high @-@ power lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in protein @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting some 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are normally advised to allevi@@ ate meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from it .
in experiments , it has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines has been found .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han nour@@ ishes more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us when the same system wir@@ ls also in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral degree Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that fav@@ ours tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been accommodated separately , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six types of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them there were missing mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria react to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i allowed to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerance @-@ enhancing cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i can protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ field player had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pounds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira launched at will .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next to M@@ atic also started Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner to the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new low@@ down for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still a SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no fire from the central party , but no tail@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the election l@@ fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , the fundamental change has changed .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with growing horror .
what Mr Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach .
there were downs .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Peter Tau@@ ber , Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis by the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) .
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the absurd Dutch Gre@@ ens @-@ Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters &apos; welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and election campaign leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) editorial network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD leader si@@ ghs , when on Friday morning the new job message reaches the party centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the tak@@ eover of the green de@@ pu@@ ties .
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland region in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades cal@@ med up at that time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into th@@ aw , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smooth .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ging in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just sli@@ pped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next low@@ down .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the crisis communication he did everything wrong after that , which one can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in the criticism for a long time .
mic@@ rot@@ echni@@ cal surveys were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , in the past few weeks Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained not hidden by com@@ rade in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party &apos;s internal purpose of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Mr Schulz at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the stub@@ born parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Mrs. T@@ ests makes her own career lunch on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but by the Landes@@ list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters face four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony &apos;s SPD as a candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
Förder@@ gel@@ der for Local Auth@@ orities III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his home in the years can soon get support from the country .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg City Development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a look back on what happened until now .
since 1991 , it has been in sensitive areas of rehabilitation .
back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation field II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous refur@@ bish@@ ment is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote inner development as well , and not only to open new areas of construction .
on April 4 , one of the District President Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros from the country , the rest of the community are sensitive .
how does a rehabilitation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Sch@@ in@@ dler will continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the boundaries of the area could then shift again .
the bridge was represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the Federal State Program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the refur@@ bish@@ ment would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , in the context of which the participants in the renovation area received a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the aim of the sentence is to take place as soon as possible , so that in the coming year can be started with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commune must carry out the said preliminary investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to assess and decide when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the respective plot there will also be a renovation note in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to feel and take a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed that the project was a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and filled in by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , the structural state and the renovation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be filled only if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a stuff@@ ed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for subsidies .
in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of the funds is based on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no funding can be made for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advis@@ ing An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn event for an event that has highlighted American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military supplies to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited in addition to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ cons@@ in fire@@ man car and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft truck .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the Deputy Commander for Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was finally required .
the H@@ atch Act pro@@ hi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were shut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous uses .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential flight through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often lead to training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event consisted of the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential com@@ missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 budget , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the ref@@ unds for Do@@ D not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokesperson for the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he entered the tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
top Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga will compete in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V table .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will be appearing in Kiel on the tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V tomorrow at 11 am .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , at any rate , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially at the rear , I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assignments in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ska ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so you need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is still active at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will be in the season for his first time in this season .
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was still at the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el with the White @-@ Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories , last Sunday , against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors in January 2016 , does not fill the cad@@ re from the coach station at Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t really feel happy when he put his signature under the law on the tightening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , which are co @-@ financed with other European companies , have contributed to the construction of the North Stream 2 in Eastern Europe together with other European companies .
the dr@@ one is tremendous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp itself would have to raise the sanctions even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could refuse and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operate like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on September 1st the city Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will continue to be cooked out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh boiled .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ die , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 days of the week are eating in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff from 1st September kitchen service : they heat up the delivered foods , complement it with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , portions the meal individually , give the food off , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven @-@ party units - decide on the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the administration to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the function of the kitchen juices - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are set anew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , vice @-@ president of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will join the Council elections in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat acts to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will pass power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women to reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make a commitment to the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company weigh@@ ed about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the leader of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; saying &quot; concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the General Site Manager is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed for Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the continued commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility completely and completely . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La League likes to regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not follow N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having submitted an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insist@@ ed that the club always gave his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world been warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City had interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club in early this summer &apos;s interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the closing report for the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ensures discussions .
Christian Wei@@ l , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German Press Agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would be very useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the processes at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reporting about violence in the cats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ monkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a close feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal ped@@ ago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take protection against Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims of over@@ taking , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories of it in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the ab@@ uses sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence to Prot@@ ests in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ ec@@ ologist and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger does not exist at all .
there are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspici@@ on of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the violence exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
it is possible to pre@@ ju@@ gate it at best , learn from it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ gymn@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - as liter@@ al - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger give a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies and &quot; always lag@@ ged from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion , which also led to erup@@ tions .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also distributed cat@@ ches and too che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that .
to his salvation , however , must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the primary school , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
there is a question of whether it is not more familiar with its public@@ ity and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI . many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
in the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who never understood it are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , the report also reports much about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant in the context of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report any involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no .
not one of 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claim to have entrusted themselves to the domin@@ ance master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a affected person for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who , however , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was reck@@ oned to him ... bombs more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to her parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that students and / or their surroundings affected themselves in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ t from any co @-@ knowing .
it can also not be accused of preventing or displaying it .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former estate master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking ahead &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed up in the reporting and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
however , this is a mis@@ use of the report .
in fact , it is separated clean@@ ly : between the primary school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let us say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report dealt with incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Cathedral cats .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were recru@@ ited and painted , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was , as most of the witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories of it in spite of violence . &quot;
this way , at most , remains the reproach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely lose their ears from the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points this out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the punishment would continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent entry .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when testing pun@@ ish@@ ments were also banned in Bavaria .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows still .
it was difficult to estimate where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he always had looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the examination was officially aboli@@ shed in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards for the time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past to present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the princess is quite right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken out in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then practice .
this is all quite horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , that is , ear fig@@ s and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of its Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger plays in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test result in language as well ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
nevertheless , I did not deny that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys do not even make a big singer and stand before each success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamentally ben@@ evol@@ ent , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ able people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something in a fly too .
I regularly get in touch with how many former dom@@ es are still in contact with him today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ zation , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and that they are down@@ gra@@ ding them .
and please , again very clearly : everything you submit to him are educational methods that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps still Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
