<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows, who had to get upset, because the car-navi was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but that is why they are very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich-Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a tile carpet which one does not recognize alike.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture map, detailed maps, so-called urine heets, have been incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographic record of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map were:</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The datasheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek (Bavarian State Library).</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison between early and today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was found 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, as Munich's district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-in-hand numbered plots from the so-called "Urabsorption" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots give no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the" "" "Land in Sun" "" "plant." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at Gasteig" "" "or from the height" "" "on the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the" "" "Munich Circle Irrenanstalt" "" "was founded on the Auer Lüfs." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder headed the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought into connection with King Ludwig II's death.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended for example buying the so-called" "" "Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet at the Salesianum in Munich on the grounds of the former institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of TSV München East, east of residential buildings dating back to the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in architecturally reminiscent of the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered around 1856 as" "" "Main Square" "", "the Kaufingerstrasse was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombings broke many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 will take place the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Ombudsman group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a series of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and can be noted here," "" "says the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, and the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have breaches of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear ailments in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he no longer had any petrol during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Office of the Missouri General Assembly, showing that the fact that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more frequent than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring about buying money or know the relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime program that classifies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiled.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidiscreaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU village association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs at the Recgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young mammals supplied and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionales only come to the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "" "as" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, much must be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if it does not lead to bioactivity.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">With a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they will continue their operations," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism because of the support.</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were encircled by the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is 40 hectares, which can not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 500 the half was funded by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the durability of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Care Center (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a flow rate specified by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosures should not be ineffective (slope inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fischerbacher fence project, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated conflict with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took on its meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the furious words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, your oppressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words on the basis for their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilante.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not charging anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the remored world: "Lady Liberty proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, elting, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not supposed to enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team for team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "Black says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally included were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midrange runner Muir goes on this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="150">"" "the team captain says she is" "" "very proud" "" "to the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to Podia.</seg>
<seg id="155">Concerning my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the hot-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped at the criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we will be led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"" "" "" "Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page." ""</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy at his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post office and appealed to the Catholic faith.</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees called as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest demonstrators and silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mail-writers struck on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overpowered his office, according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after having been sued from 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environment Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce the emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of governmental environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Labour Court.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumbling celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether it is an idyllic location and a beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius system is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlin their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer judgments: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen along with the bird abbey "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, besides the former parish church, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patronage was one and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, there was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" the third, the noble settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 support these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit that church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two collapsed at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell units were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to plunge in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörbauler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night of 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlin on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local President Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the Serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers set out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of great importance for tumbling and hearing welding.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumlin feel particularly committed to homeland care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind-force concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="511">Although the town of Viersen had agreed a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan - but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a malfunction.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen was indirectly involved, concluded lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this equates to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-day households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, four-year-old town council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a wooden arch bridge covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metre wide and seven tons heavy bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border attachment, which is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday a 2,20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to go.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is about finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football associations will not interfere with Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will happen for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must sometime prove that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose for Neymar to sign it and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team through the vast power of Qatar's wealthy family.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but must be controlled with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners drew back their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to a harder task.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "during the current three-year" "" "FFP" "" "period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, the UEFA sequel Aleksander Ceferin continues to reduce excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outlist their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">That was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the World Cup Organizing Committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar World Cup messengers will be identified and such maneuver could be easy for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to consider every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after the signing will rise by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1190">"" "at one point a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and" "" "a number of other things from 1991." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil Plot, in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good feeling of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippet of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of accidental madness that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieved what I suppose as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" at Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," at the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its east-eastward-west ring combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing's Tatum (also a executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game "Finde the voice out."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it's gone, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reduced to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop-satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can make everything to feed.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, resigned in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Storage and an mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overlap so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative in order to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let it work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went into it," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counter-important so that when you push the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which will help create emotional ties in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and elevated square meter by some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court in order to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family established jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but raises Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was annoyed for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election campaigns, consists in ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trumps tweets would not have included any more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates were able to keep him out of trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to present their own agenda by presenting Trump stuff that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the predilection of advisors to give the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative media cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone malicious hosts a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile to be" leaks "in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicane or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had voiced false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin by the horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, weighing over a trillion metric ton and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice colds that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual collisions in the region for about 30 years, and the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) has been in a facet background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now demolished colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhols swims over the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C horseshoe is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abuses was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete horseshoe is discarded there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger, as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece is broken off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of shellfish and iceberg does not increase the sea level, since they float on the water and press ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes for the observation of the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C horseshoe is the fourth-biggest horseshoe of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It regularly breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural phenomenon and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C horseshoe will grow back or go back long and possibly collapse," "" "his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "" "Our models say it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers fail to bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many cuddly snuffles of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years and therewith visitates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied positions in the circle of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration are looked for.</seg>

<seg id="1627">During e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup FIFA are on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long been established, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And e-sports is already part of the official program at the Asian Games 2022.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is safe getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobber has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as callbacks.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "For there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he proposed himself among other things as a character for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris ended the breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures romp in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small brick, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf ciones, and with very dry weather, there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite from violence, and while the bodies are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under German protection for attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep even though his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the killers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inseparable and even though the terrain is still more puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little value, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all distrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically no silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country as rival factions are struggling to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of adorned, two-story mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel factions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangs bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security, after confiscating another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the poison of drugs," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper served a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "" "for its coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you are referring to as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the spawn-bird, who could curl like a dockworker, the friend who generously was with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Is his love for routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is going on with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself designated as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has been licking on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one where a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went in the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have grown louder by writing down in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and put them around because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked for her to be subdivided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and an equally valid society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">"" "in his last book" "" "Narco-Journalism" "", "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that put together the organised crime under a blanket." ""</seg>

<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted from enough pressure by eating meat eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras, or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodose-rier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs ropredators have to have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the beast in evidence of his life, including his conserved Darminhaltes in order to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and was driven into the sea, where he sank at the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Noeraurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost as much today as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's on bed. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant geodes, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine close to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the dusty-covered dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hips.</seg>
<seg id="1961">On average, the creatures weighed about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the undercover of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The clogged remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover hollowed armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rare as a win in the lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers crossed upward.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole. "</seg>
<seg id="1971">In the thunderstorm: mass arambolage on A8: many wounded</seg>
<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometers-long Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Around 20 people were injured at the Stuttgart-München (A8) motorway on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, at 17 o'clock there were almost 30 vehicles between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first there are no information on the exact number of the injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was mild to moderate injuries, said a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of the city of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long retreat was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ reporter, it was also on the counter-trajectory to massive obstructions - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade was the hallmark of the vehicle electricians, who now have to reckon with sensitive punches.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 o'clock there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: you are sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the merciless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by a mobile phone that you take your seat and validate your ticket.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to buy an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to have bought it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant comes to Platz Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can sleep, work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"" "the" "" "check-in" "" "has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2012">Who travels often knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the travel card controls are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, however, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whosis Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after arriving in New York City, the one sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retuned on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and by a man who claimed to be Browns's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>

<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of people living in community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local registrant who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism changed totally after August 9," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "" "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their votes and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, as these people are portrayed, as I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but a community that is coming together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love with her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that in this work and in the humanisation of black people there must be certain vulnerability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they have not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has been splitting the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves any cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"" "also on our Facebook page" "" "Volksfreund Bitburg" "", "the issue is discussed." ""</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery runs more customers into the city, including the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the property where the market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a Markthalle into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop shops are empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But as there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, that resemble themselves almost imperceptibly - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haarsections, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where former secret service analyst consolidated a 35-year sentence after making public diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering dissident, whose sentence was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how anyone could look with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but spoke openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of the espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning sits clearly on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became too unequal, interchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President Chelate would transform his judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the governmental camp and against transgender forces in order to find new, tweetable ways to further flames the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname has a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novels mentioned above.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>

<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the spot and detectives investigate the engravings as murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem have now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>

<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian deputy director Vitaly Mutko said it won't take a long time until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's schedule to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and recently published on the website of the organization.</seg>

<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2195">In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the execution of doping controls in Russia in the course of the doping scandal.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called for help from outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, to offer special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company which shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low approval results - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisance in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the financial engineering website of Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fall in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent companies can send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves ethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the Convercent company employs, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice - more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view of the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who manages the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will support the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only applications.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve returns if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about the employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, if a company asks employees according to your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "if you don't follow, employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And if you don't care about why I should? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employees surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan issued a further 7395 national servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>

<seg id="2358">Three times they applauded their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even crazier in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey when he released his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern scexpugs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more worrying as many robots possess the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a Stepford-woman progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern slipping dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyshness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyshness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible," "" "warms the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, it also has its moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the attacks on rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" "" "is it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origin and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not keep sex robots, and while the FRR sees their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has bothered to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the slipped body and the exhibited eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities" the robots do not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrases of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all allegedly committed to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notice has been the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-directed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and quite strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to make the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is related to me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the saving effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the cruelly possibility that his bikers will no longer repel us of one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, "normalized" in the Trump Republican of the Right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both compared to Trump are indeed a very mild criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals are twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cyclical music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics-pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department was apologizing, while I was tired of having the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder, who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say it is too tolerant.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>

<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken-puffer, a small eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of him smote the eagle, and stretched out his wings on a high mountain, and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles that bore cylinders to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young-animal is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">He will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Its purpose is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished each four-year sler that he feels accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">This was followed by a letter of thanks to the colleagues, the former school director Michael Müller, who always jumps at school bottlenecks and the parental representatives.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, is going to retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - suitable candidates are, however, rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For 31 years, Wacker is Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it surprised him that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should be enough time for a revision in compliance with the regular notice deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the Administrative Community as a sub-construction law agency, the applicant must submit relevant certificates.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they can no longer fill them out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of the town and the city is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as a good atmosphere between the authority and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2563">If you want to bury Roland Wacker, after information about the city of Haslach, you should have completed your studies as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree with specialisation architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning.</seg>

<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not come out, but they had delays.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch some 200 meters of high-power lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in protein-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting some 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are normally advised to alleviate meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from it.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its intestines has been found.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan nourishes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system wirls also in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral degree Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that favours tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been accommodated separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were found six types of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them there were missing mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria react to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri allowed to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but if tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri can protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2673">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives Steg City Development on Wednesday in sensation.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave once again a look back on what happened until now.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, it has been in sensitive areas of rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation field II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the previous refurbishment is a "success project" - it is important to promote inner development as well, and not only to open new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, one of the District President Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 Euros from the country, the rest of the community are sensitive.</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the aim of the sentence is to take place as soon as possible, so that in the coming year can be started with the restructurings.</seg>

<seg id="2890">This means the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The closing report for the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen ensures discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weil, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are Church," stated after publication against the German Press Agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "on the other hand, the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "criticised that" "" "two measures" "" "in reporting about violence in the cats." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it would have to be "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarmonkey." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you like to go to the church and this is a close feeding." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take protection against Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims of overtaking, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students was even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories of it in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuses scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of Violence of Violence to Protests in the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholecologist and perfectionist, which became tangible when a Domspatz did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger does not exist at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">There are just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violence excesses at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to prejugate it at best, learn from it too late or have not taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzenggymnum, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - as literal - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger give a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "honest," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and "always lagged from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotion, which also led to eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just knead with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also distributed catches and too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the primary school, this is certainly Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is a question of whether it is not more familiar with its publicity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI. many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian pope many people who never understood it are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media, the report also reports much about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen plant in the context of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report any involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the dominance master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said a affected person for the others," "" "I was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who, however, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective offender.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it was reckoned to him... bombs more intrusive or clearer or even more open than to her parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that students and / or their surroundings affected themselves in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempt from any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It can also not be accused of preventing or displaying it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "violence excesses" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former estate master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking ahead" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed up in the reporting and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">However, this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">In fact, it is separated cleanly: between the primary school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, let us say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report dealt with incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were recruited and painted, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the Domspatzenggymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was, as most of the witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "" "primary school" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzenggymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even have positive memories of it in spite of violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">This way, at most, remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger resolutely lose their ears from the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzenggymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points this out," "" "that in the primary school the punishment would continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent entry.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when testing punishments were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he always had looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards for the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past to present moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess is quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrendable at all times and also not for what was broken out in the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that then practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, that is, ear figs and hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>

<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not deny that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Weltrang, of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>

<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamentally benevolent, deep-believing and hearable people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do something in a fly too.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them.</seg>

<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
