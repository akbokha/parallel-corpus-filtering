J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck out of the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , pre@@ m TV with lo@@ cker@@ em d@@ utch and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the white blood she brings the question about the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sports Pyr@@ amid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ o : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Sports Pyr@@ amid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they drove home to the feed trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he let himself lead with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sport volunteers handed over the Golden Sport pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala .
there is no lack of acc@@ ol@@ ades to the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyr@@ amid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 more outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master si@@ eger was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among these are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ reiter Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports le@@ agues came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ common in terms of tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical contrast .
he , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax his economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will have a massive return to regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money .
that is why taxes would increase for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton are almost verb@@ ose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ach@@ ers wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so there could be no party discussions on Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to further expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but rather to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid better then , for example , for Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics think that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby who is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene looks normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralised dwell@@ ings for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has long been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men are fle@@ eing because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope bearer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal secretly from them because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience of sexual violence , compul@@ sion , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this continues her .
on the escape , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be seen as inferior or ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know to help , there are more accommodations just for them , requests B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their field of competence , some answers with no .
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses for single women and their children only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or are accommodated together men and women , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read out on the crowd that there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr says .
one could easily make a second home .
Regi@@ stra@@ r general strikes : demands for new work combat measures
representatives of the Regi@@ stra@@ r have called on their union to appro@@ ve new employment measures in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to address the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , resident doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in elections .
in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would &quot; pers@@ ist quietly &quot; to problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC committee has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working combat measures that begins in early September .
the con@@ ten@@ tions led to the fact that assistance doctors in this year strike six times , the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA Assistant doctors , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be compulsory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be dirty and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erd@@ og@@ an would have beha@@ ved as if something bad would never happen .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that the head of state Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin condemned and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia .
the transgres@@ sion was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
building the ve@@ to will be difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies he wanted to hear from President Erd@@ og@@ an .
Russia was able to win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an first of all needs all the friends he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West since its reaction to the attempted sei@@ z@@ ure of power is considered a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state leader in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that are off the west and feel badly treated and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently given itself the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents of the press conference said they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired up Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , the R@@ BS shall only be reduced to a back@@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected with the global ambi@@ tions of the Bank .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumer labels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralized headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our investment brand as well as to the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that its Six Nations sponsorship will no longer be continued and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , for how do we concentrate inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori recei@@ veth the che@@ er when he ob@@ tains the victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .

Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone that only few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy his two @-@ fl@@ utes and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0,@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his head of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of the tigh@@ test confidence group of Putin for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it reads that without giving reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discharge of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the director and staff leader of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned upon his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , there are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so does the result of a kind of power struggle occur here ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V participated in the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , closest ally , Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his cancellation .
on the set it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
I regret the incident , &quot; he said in a message .
details of how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned charism@@ a of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for the fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff requested help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act as sandals that were reflected by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing the bridge : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lashes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown presented a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering work of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
all in all , nearly 79 % of the total deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a g@@ ong for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project , the closure is a tr@@ end@@ setting high and low building .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap to the north or the land@@ side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
my grand@@ son , as the tolerances to which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off of ang@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station from Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat apart from their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ath@@ engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered off the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today w@@ akes over these men .
seriously injured - man pi@@ cks up his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when he came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then alert his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to re@@ assure her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companion .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : investors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments may also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the big issue in the town hall is , however , that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left also wants to impose tough@@ er conditions for investors .
no matter how viol@@ a , an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about getting the apartments back to the price tie .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the West@@ stadt , deadlines are running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price tie for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing estate companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the western city is increased dramatically again , one removes itself from the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; mixture . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no more concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few districts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and children no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s ( later this resulted in a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture , the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation playing the game when it was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , following the 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the game was launched , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , rose from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be reviewed .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also rum@@ ors that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to be ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have been able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be made with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all of the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on a beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant . on the whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast became a multi@@ player on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ kam@@ er@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish bar during the women &apos;s multi @-@ combat event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title , and the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey to an end at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as a unique ath@@ lete like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es won the last three years of sport , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged themselves after they won gold and silver in the lon@@ ge@@ vity of women &apos;s solo campaigns at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on never having planned the future during their long journey , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - included in their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man during a school excursion into the gym , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost any competition competition , a series of victories that will stop as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
bri@@ tish beams and floor bul@@ bs - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she took up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and placed one on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them sof@@ tly when they expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ hood , which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a ledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise she fell to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doubt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims of mass mur@@ der@@ ous appl@@ ause when listening to music in the car
according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot who died in one of the most deadly attacks of Phoenix in the first series of mur@@ der@@ ous attacks since they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired up eight shots from a handful of fire@@ arms while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled to another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or attack , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in 9 attacks against seven people within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund could never see them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year and he still cannot speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund thought for &quot; Please sing something before me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are bringing the sign language to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses like meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I have not asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to tell me someone really .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floods their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National weather service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told us that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were growing .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service reported that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the area of mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the pre @-@ locations near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger , as these flowing rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still connected people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose overnight .
he said that he would have warned him of another son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers would have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer moved near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was considerably absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 flood @-@ flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals r@@ ins@@ ed by floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but on Friday they have not been reported until now .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the transmitter .
I simply cannot believe it .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot on , reports the transmitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently came to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ lap the crime scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continual battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were bus@@ ses .
thus it seems to have given several armed fighters who were actively involved , &quot; Police Head@@ man Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di told the police station in Philadelphia .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present at the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that is for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ esses , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has strengthened the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female gymn@@ asi@@ ums was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympi@@ ad of the Olympic Games .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for multiple campaig@@ ners .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country do not look like this .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four female gymn@@ as@@ tics in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ asi@@ ums lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer the municipalities un@@ coun@@ table , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , offering a more powerful and easier accessible training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth of high quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of Girl Power by holding the olymp@@ ic team and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors who voted at a vote rejected him .
in July , H@@ unt &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend files in order to improve the maintenance at irregular times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the B@@ MA Committee for Assist@@ ance , commented in a message that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assist@@ ance doctors have still serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the present crisis and treat it to all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA for resol@@ ving disputes through conversations met with the government for reluc@@ t@@ ance to participate and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made just last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do so , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were involved in providing medical doctors on strike .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to receive a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 Assist@@ ance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the Regi@@ stra@@ r to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working combat measures do not achieve nothing but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and had a positive response to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of curriculum , education holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can lower heart disease risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period .
the co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
N@@ ICE regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE regul@@ ators have recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the flooring breaks out , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the N@@ ICE proposal , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE Health @-@ Technology Assessment Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness lets electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from the office .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored , such as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over @-@ sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ist , said the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut@@ ters outside of electoral cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a passport to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er just needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes that not removable ink should be placed on a person &apos;s finger when they leave their voting voice to prevent anyone hi@@ el@@ ting twice .
whist@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose Him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation where a person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent post @-@ election - among the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading evidence to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been raised that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the older , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over eth@@ ni@@ cities and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter voting documents in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ ap@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
non removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when she has left her voice to prevent anyone hi@@ el@@ ting twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists are editing full let@@ ter@@ press and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ press .
the police have the authority to establish barriers to electoral stations .
a change of law which facilitates an accus@@ ation of intim@@ id@@ ation based on the re@@ pres@@ sions of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally assert that voters go alone in the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls above the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty - in accordance with the high demands in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the town hall houses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come across the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T aside from the edge and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ runner of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only ath@@ lete to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created lists of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the racing track , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be .
the team member of the US team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he looks closely similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is to pass through as a double @-@ go@@ ddess for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Theatre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to the same &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the space provided : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face @-@ face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles her own beautiful , wide smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese swimming in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el emp@@ tied spectators of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ om@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and died during the race like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he ended his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought on board to the C@@ BS commentary team in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the s@@ wimm@@ ers 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator say just that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer of China &quot; like a pig died ? ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming staff@@ el for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with many people talking about it .
Twitter users didn &apos;t keep back when they heard how in@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times at the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ ald via Twitter
the comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave us a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed very much yesterday night with our viewers on show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
in order to clarify one , By@@ tom &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s session in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the shop
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a mark to try to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she numbered , as she looked at it , pulled her back and put her back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of bott@@ oms in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the primary business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the trousers before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of trousers from the delivery , pulled out her own stock@@ ing trousers and pants and ta@@ sted them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete location to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the trousers which you obviously didn &apos;t like , because they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , moved back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther someone watching - or thinking about the person who , under circumstances , would buy the lower trousers she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think that someone would take home with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out and she wasn &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9th at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to spin the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you get closer to you , you should turn around as a first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your el@@ bow .
then beat him with the knee into the cr@@ ust and twist , while the att@@ acker cre@@ eps before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they judge the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , seize the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ tends Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t his tongue for a guide to the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and saus@@ age @-@ lex a serious test - taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
prior to checking every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to leave .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of replacing the r@@ ins@@ ing @-@ button of a pull @-@ in toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , soil , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he justified his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial period showed a lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of over 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a r@@ ussi@@ an toilet which he refused to decline after their lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to check anything here , because it is in a disgu@@ sting place .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Vice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , ending that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the direction of the film , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he li@@ cked some of the things I had to lick him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destro@@ ys before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social dwelling in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ ci@@ al family left her social dwelling after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls pointed out holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this estate is thought to be thought to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and her call is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment temporarily and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on lease , was an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police to be inv@@ oked .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated them and their partners this week forci@@ bly from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the covered side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their families , as del@@ eting is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , as the behaviour was extreme and had to be deter@@ rent for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously joined us and have provided us with the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that s@@ wir@@ ls back in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ oc@@ ating on the ground
workers of the house management will now have to move garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of money after having found himself guilty of the possession of a class B drug in trade fores@@ ight .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house order
Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that del@@ eting a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can take themselves without blame , and those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic , after a ti@@ ff@@ led military jet flies over the beach
sun beds in Av@@ eiro , Portugal lived the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air force forces put an incredible flight back
the air@@ strips stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no risk of safety .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet is crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity to the sun @-@ bet@@ ting on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle movements without first seeing what came to it through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to see them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility due to the poor visibility in the vicinity there was a bit deeper than usual , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which also four people on the island of Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - which restric@@ ts his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ ade in most of the other applications had the advantage .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .

Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow coun@@ try@@ man and defending champion Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided finale in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this the world @-@ ranking first brought the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ di@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between sets and with time outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches so far I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ hang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the Chinese flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the record , leaving Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma it did not develop the expected thrilling match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , sufficient breath @-@ taking was to be seen .
Mi@@ di@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had drawn up a ri@@ b injury , after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .

Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits major problems ″ in the campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states to lose its majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now gave up weaknesses of his election campaign in U@@ tah &apos;s former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts grow at his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took up his well @-@ known media school .
stir up republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey carried out by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his competi@@ tor of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
in an interview with the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clin@@ ton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him , for reasons of political correctness , it is not sufficient for him to be ok , Tru@@ mp said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp should have threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better surveys .
instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would attack the Congress more strongly for the Congress .
Olympia : three @-@ dimensional fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach back home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary informed that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , delivered a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the Dop@@ ing Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker shared with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , gave the trial and signed it , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as boss de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against money @-@ making athletes of his country .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly been arrested at his return to the Nairobi airport .
the IO@@ C has been under special observation for a long time at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing transgres@@ sions .
at the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympic Games .
as a result , WA@@ DA launched Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have repeatedly been raised that dop@@ ing agents in Kenya are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had done in Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it has been proven that in this type of sport a systematic and systematic thought has been made .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she is reminiscent of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time .

K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family underwent a few weeks ago from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after giving information to her family after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the East of London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in case of election victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell , believes that the next president will nom@@ inate the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain measure of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not provide un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Jud@@ ge of the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , Lak@@ ai and Hel@@ per Workers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring forth a 1970 &quot; s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine distinguishes between Old@@ school Play@@ boys , because Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently it is the view that it also does the Calendar .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass exo@@ dus
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re not adapting to Erd@@ og@@ an , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in short , the Kurdish municipality of Germany counts tens of thousands of protection @-@ seek@@ ers fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard work of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany is expecting mass exo@@ dus to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with imp@@ unity , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey are fle@@ eing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the frozen put@@ sch there were still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Commerce charged the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
this would increase Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the board demanded that the Federal Government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand name as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not suit themselves and lo@@ osen Erd@@ og@@ an sit on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks have already set the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on 30 June , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) people as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is not war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country tag .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year 2021 .
because stupid than so far , it &apos;s not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that is the case .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see on the way , are not local , so you are not allowed to choose the country tag .
there are practical problems for this : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end voices , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign , you can see from his big posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary silent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise pastoral care has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for Af@@ D &apos;s blossom@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which probably will cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its nick@@ name , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is when at the wrong time it is the right place to campaign .
she has twice invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to open documents ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary circuit lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it was too bad for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U does not disp@@ ense with the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also stated that in the country it is crum@@ bling the basis that it must be very tough to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ ses of the country hardly exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is a lot on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were last at least 22 per cent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country tag .
they are making a modern virtue out of their holiday @-@ ad@@ versity , and they are largely involved in the internet of their election campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on search for local vocal ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , is winding straight through the Mecklenburg Lake with a hous@@ ebo@@ at and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
there are all praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ends at 8@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite z@@ ag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the weekend , until the end of October everything should be finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remuneration of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ avi@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg also exists , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Florian King , the deputy head manager responsible for the traffic management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ throughput Street , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ outs were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks were in use in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not observed , the municipality encouraged the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself clear about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have already been made .
the fastest was at 77 hours in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men on the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to revenue break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the refur@@ bish@@ ment has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , holder of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers in H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are deci@@ ph@@ ered to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such a generous deal was handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars are now less frequent due to complicated transport .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else nice .
that his family climate is coming back at the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history .
six months of construction work , it is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly screwed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now laying a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what has a sense of ul@@ c@@ efulness to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demand no one .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was positioned on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has passed a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on passenger information and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities does not come as a surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still considers it reasonable and also demands nothing that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a safety check .
in the case of de@@ ple@@ tion for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sensitive .
some of them also have an un@@ checked and open questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this really have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be denied that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in the face of the high refugee figures , many people were worried about security .
and things that were deeply involved in people could not be cl@@ utter@@ ed even in campaign times .
the internal security is enormously moved into focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ gling argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a turn away from a double pass he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been discussing the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to make it new , don &apos;t make sense .
and in the case of a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , does not yet have to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the SPD is also trying to profit from internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about anything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
in spite of diesel prices , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
with the recall action , there is confusion around a term .
Volkswagen will run into the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can continue to present an increase in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July , VW &apos;s core brand VW weaker especially in Western Europe and once again exposed the sale of the sale as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold the VW brand with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
sales alone in Western Europe , the second most important market in China , were up 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s currency .
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
head of the brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU also stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the US , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is further off lightly by the diesel @-@ sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is now available .
from January to July , Chief Executive Officer Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales platform .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated by a software exhaust system .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer after retro@@ fitting , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen gives its German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW &apos;s representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that if fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output do not take place after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all typical vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , after retro@@ fitting , customers can come to a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid the risk of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust @-@ sc@@ andal , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands heavy savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; managing director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and sees in it no signal : normal savers would not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity criminal interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is asking for deposits of more than 100,000 euros for deposits of over 100,000 euros for deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
for some time now , he kept 40 million euros , which could be raised from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now continues the costs according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
leaving the cash simply in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank@@ note .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co@@ operatives association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically durable is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , head of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits for deposits , so the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more lush from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she kept money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank G@@ mund , which was founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern Union &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association , which charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be pleased with this in terms of width .
Dest@@ ination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ age love records .
before you hurry to comment , in order to sow it under the pseud@@ onym Non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ ame men &apos;s middle ages with ar@@ du@@ ous ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed recovery of vinyl records is not due to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but also to Mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight after at age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ de by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ go@@ v ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and sav@@ age wild@@ ly before I stand , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic disk specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these vinyl records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and started buying their old records again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the record @-@ revi@@ vals of a particular age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl record covers , from objects that evoke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff member is fl@@ ot@@ ting from a stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no turn@@ table .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I &apos;m looking for a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data count : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP so that I can put them on the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ aned out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but standing psych@@ ic trauma is hard to imagine if one is standing next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window shopping as a wholesale purchase .
she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to mut@@ ate the pants in the jeans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are grouped for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others , is also the one that most for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record business and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they ste@@ er away from the star@@ ing gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who raises over the shoulders of the middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional transactions in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional deals , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the low @-@ entry was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which was used non @-@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer .
despite the dis@@ appointment of the Olympics : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in October in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion who had lost on the 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ plates will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement trailer from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident centers , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary Tem@@ polar , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary heater for compliance with speed limit@@ er .
a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as drive pro@@ hibitions after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
to ensure that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also shot @-@ proof outer she@@ ath .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter against v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and has now also been used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year .
Britain brings silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class brings gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ th Ru@@ g@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ e Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , backing , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic med@@ als of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - the fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in the form of this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t be that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan they lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and left the attacks of G@@ Bs off fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a showed a touch down in the right corner and 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ at@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still being taught .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ ates , whose fans sang , flags pi@@ ed and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whist@@ le sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged , and GB ki@@ cked off in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ year @-@ old team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than in those games and that wants to be called .
from the first rowing down to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when they buried the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ th un@@ slain deployment , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no one more assistant than the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ giving morning to talk a little more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , the cent@@ uri@@ on of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it repe@@ ats only how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be nobody , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; pale in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do anything T@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about the future .
Glo@@ ver will appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller will reti@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original on a part of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia dig@@ ni@@ fied the purpose association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group charges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all that is Rupert G@@ öller , who was a member of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband for 31 years , 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brunn Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Rupert G@@ öller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of the floo@@ ding tanks ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re@@ ali@@ zations of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there has always been new additions , because water is water and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Gö@@ ll &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blin@@ dness for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived with the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
in his turn , Rupert G@@ öller praised Water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful pop @-@ up .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ building and the re@@ organization of the purpose @-@ association .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture at the Hoch@@ pot at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with tubes .
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds in the succession of Rupert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko openly goes with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other interested parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have the courage to speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a .
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago is well forward and will now learn private in New York , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something two years ago when I sang Scala in Milan , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Schrot@@ t .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots on a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45@@ am in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and killed them mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man was inv@@ oked by us and indicated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be made public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could be traveling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
who sees Sven S. , should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t want to give any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ gang or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; but she confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation command@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens threatened by the branch of green energy are from the table .
it remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion at the existing plants for so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to request the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the ste@@ el@@ works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 per cent is applied .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on own electricity generation .
thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation escal@@ ated further when the world &apos;s largest producer of producer China threw mass steel onto the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers present price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imported import duties on import steel effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have risen .
unclear is how sustainable price recovery is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted not to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year , as reported by the Steel Division on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May the resulting crowd went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , mind , health : sing does sen@@ iors good
the singing accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teacher education she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors chor@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular cohesi@@ on , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures in old age dissolve , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the pu@@ sts too quickly even in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors .
in the older generation , the common singing had a much higher significance , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or hearing songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
thanks to lyrics and especially melodies , people deny themselves to long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special achievement is required for the head , explained L@@ enz .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people , who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks not having little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a tone goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the familiar circle in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found over the internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help in internet research .
anyone who likes singing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats respond more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover what effect the herds of cat @-@ boys on adult animals have .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , in contrast to the females , they always beha@@ ved immediately .
female cats can recognize the degree of patho@@ gen@@ esis of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the veter@@ inary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the livestock hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for the one calls of little ones , who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited kit@@ ten that were additionally lifted up .
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when the calls of the more excited kit@@ ten were playing .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were m@@ oms or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
a warrant of arrest had been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game is taking place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even at the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempt to overthrow the state of emergency in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the daily life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch .
it does not stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against former Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver &apos;s former strong scientist .
according to this , Sü@@ ver &apos;s meanwhile living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver is to be followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact the life of most Turks did not have any impact on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has ended Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the labor club Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as traditionally do not belong to the friends of the president .
but what unites the great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially possible to arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne event proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his club .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 winning buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; say good@@ bye to the Europa League early .
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g , it only reached rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as the game year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 season figures as the Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cher King .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as only sold out Gom@@ ez after the attempted put@@ sch , the political situation in the country did not return to his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker should be willing to reno@@ unce around one @-@ third of his annual growth of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We cannot pay its sal@@ aries in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .

other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the subject of dop@@ ing is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed her starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing @-@ lock , was plu@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at its start ( 100 meters ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a bizarre scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a whi@@ rl@@ wind .
but there are still a lot of other sports@@ men who go to the Rio Olympics in spite of the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world for more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ times world champion had to sit on a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she had strong too@@ th@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Champion in 2013 and European Championship was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sent@@ encing and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible for you .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave the Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the Euro title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgement of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record player and gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence was found on the intake of a forbidden health supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA dropped mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for the foreign ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I was able to leave it again .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also affected by Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a b@@ ump of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two le@@ aps went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
the det@@ onation near the seaside resort Pat@@ ong popular for holi@@ day@@ makers was injured by a taxi driver .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives set out in a flower be@@ et in front of the Re@@ vier of the coastal police .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called several wounded .
a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express itself to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days the authorities have kept secret clu@@ es about forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and the places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still be unclear which group st@@ ole behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the well @-@ term bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian State Department recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were only a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits great influence to the military in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ cha @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to pen@@ alize chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody tur@@ mo@@ il , considers himself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the revol@@ ting uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
less than a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several provincial com@@ missions , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in an extreme way .
that is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ult@@ i @-@ del@@ usion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitu@@ tion@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts are trying to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
that would be Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda should address people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this species are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be ri@@ gh@@ tist structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Old School Society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frei@@ tal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or groups of groups , who are planning attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
at the same time , Ma@@ ate expressed his concern that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who hadn &apos;t appeared in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum lod@@ gings had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts that might have been politically in@@ different or , for example , CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist voice @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games and World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer festivals in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place from 59 starts .
but it was rather a rather sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special launch from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more known in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Et@@ th@@ op@@ ia , Hab@@ mere wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ b of W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was funny about him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle with a minute and almost five seconds , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have also been drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i &apos;s run caused media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to run alone in a subur@@ b over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US President , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then drives into the holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either work , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US television broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ BC .
if for him , at the end , for reasons of political correctness , it is fine , said Tru@@ mp .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , last but not least , more and more resistance was formed .
post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously big .
the post is planning to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
in a nut@@ shell , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric v@@ ans over the coming year also on the free market market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether they are delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letter and parcel , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , for example by arti@@ sans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plan to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we convert the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany &apos;s streets since 2014 .
GF@@ RP @-@ guided tour ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
Gf@@ K &apos;s consumer research company exchanges his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ drops suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company leadership , the global number five in the industry faces a new beginning .
GF@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert will already leave the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
the management board of the Management Board has already taken over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ substrate as of September 1 , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation as a reason for the cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details intended not to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , in the shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shareholders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointment of the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was large . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder is going to be rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the previous year @-@ earlier quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent with € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter weigh@@ ed above all the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the Group sales depreci@@ ation valued at the Consumer Experience business sector tot@@ alled EUR 139 million , while the Group posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
the Gf@@ K generated consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cru@@ ises in dit@@ ches : eight injured
in the case of an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hearing ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to diver@@ t its details to a vice vice , partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the accident location on the state road 2 .
the last travellers were brought back to the Kru@@ mm@@ horns district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators requested the lor@@ ry and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.3 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will rise again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf is then at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the municipal council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach established that for these wastewater facilities , under@@ cover was reported .
due to the legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment in a cost @-@ covering manner .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the se@@ wer@@ age facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated .
Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that there are relatively small facilities in all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water fall , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the volume of sewage in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , not least because of their age , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable scale .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be recovered from the ground and in the pond treatment plant L@@ opp , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be extended , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system could be installed in order to comply with the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , continued care and maintenance costs which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low se@@ wer@@ age in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years , was spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses , especially since the utility area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal sewage @-@ purpose association is not possible to expand these facilities because it concerns defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria books inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first above zero since October last year , compared to a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell for clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein picture .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies a day .
all faulty entries arrive at the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Black@@ face or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter which gave them s@@ lot@@ ted eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat communicated that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company had an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of infr@@ inging c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and un@@ pleasantly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been drag@@ ged into the falling extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tri@@ bun@@ als .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats a large audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ed in the race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters an image that is offensive for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the adjusting practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white male leadership , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently set up a staff responsible , focusing on subordin@@ ated population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she will be closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fied IS@@ IS intelligence service information , establishes committee of the Congress
military personnel from the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it permitted the actual conditions on the spot to report a congress of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Republi@@ can Committee , Intelligence Committee and military budget com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content at Central Command secret services , which reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management mistakes in the Cent@@ com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second @-@ largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command revised the intelligence reports to play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after it was added that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge as the investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments at IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ ams morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were recorded for complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor is still ongoing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air@@ campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of divisions of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupation force in Iraq , and little time disappeared about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current media coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide government agencies that contrary to the government statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this realization , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after firing three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , she knows that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group .
however , as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered an astonishing vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 seats at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things to a better place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the entrance door in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept playing from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and loaded the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in any of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inevitable , a fur@@ ious relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is served by the w@@ rist@@ band to become a tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ap@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names , which are sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was perceived so spar@@ sely that many people I had sur@@ vey@@ ed did not know that it was even an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it up to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider @-@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ist tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are assessed according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts hope to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the television broadcast also another great goal : those of the world or the Olympic @-@ ord .
the targeted aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel somewhat tired when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualifying and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear @-@ monkey and the objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his new fans after air .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demanding political changes in Ethiopia , met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia just going to break together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed eigh@@ ty un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader in the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy was expanding at a considerable rate .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , while dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ la , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who were forced more or less in recent years , could use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of getting worse under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate over Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian stron@@ gh@@ olds from Eth@@ th@@ op@@ ia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , the intelligence agencies , commerce and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly pro@@ fici@@ ent in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and render them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray area of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was experiencing such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to information provided by analysts seemed to be sli@@ pped by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ understanding of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests in the U.S. and other Western allies bring about a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin line of balancing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , fear@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republi@@ can , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand@@ ably with the American public .
it also brings his fellow workers trying to protect him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of decl@@ aring statements he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp called upon the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tically .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the Conserv@@ ative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t would help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism falls down upon Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked to Mich@@ ig@@ an &apos;s economic situation this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I thought it was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic fron@@ tiers in politics and then to rest as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , observed the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has accepted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ated tone as his demand values have gone further .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leader in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while focusing on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ally his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , to the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true , in this sense , that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely false , and that is why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama served Mrs. Clinton as an external minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by signing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sitting on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ologies as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once at the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a not@@ orious café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years served a good coffee .
of course , the prices were displaced from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the soap shop So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people rob@@ bed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and verb is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s also a re @-@ invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he began working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide funds for a new job , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained much .
verb uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are served with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ners like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ces .
there are nat@@ u@@ rop@@ ho@@ es .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez told him that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old clients were also pushed by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up a drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was in the coffee and culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not have a res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will respond to your offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ baked coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favourites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the Lok@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
its menu on this day was slightly more modest : stuff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es Last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the US , while bri@@ ck@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock exchange crash in 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered chi@@ ppers , this was the pair for discussing the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which extends the ingredient .
imagine to eat as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male Fel@@ ine and it was served fresh baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows the ways with which the country moved with it no longer to be the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e announced why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ies became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ generating food residue , &quot; noted brick , as chefs were able to hide non @-@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tried out because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy dishes .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics - between 1923 and 1943 - adopted the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeping &quot; women and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million man of the world to whom he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the lawyers of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved a little reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in the Assad regime &apos;s bomb attack itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group which , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers play their own lives in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant who showed him in a 11 hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , save life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrels of drums over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a wife and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this long @-@ term lifestyle , however , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed for a long time that Greenland will become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie is hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know correspon@@ dingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
she measured her slow motion when she station@@ ed six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
loo@@ t still makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bones of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ aver who tor@@ tured from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this center of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons testing larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens @-@ core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females can only get offspring if they are longer than four metres , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ arks with the multip@@ lication apparently leave at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck stuck a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on fl@@ ames .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often especially big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal sheds heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipal council has focused on issues relating to construction in the recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the panel adopted the communication by mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ enth@@ esis and closing questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying could be provided , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; road road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the land areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ ler can now report in the town hall , on the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to also submit en@@ quiries relating to the settlement of other industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created only in the spring of this year .

Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt profits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough for them to be admitted to the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is using very large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , however , as well as Dublin , it is worse off the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
in addition , the city with easily available commercial real estate is located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city was standing on No@@ .@@ 7 , Luxemburg on No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , my business researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in accordance with figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry in London , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to refund the legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liber@@ ated from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ der and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to obtain the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and claimed to be the property of laboratory work that Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir an@@ ground@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are conducting clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released her declaration of tax on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term in the State Department .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate for Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax statements for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ actors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements even though they are not required by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for their refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business forms and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his declaration of tax .
on Thursday , she addressed the subject also during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that Tru@@ mp paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million and pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax returns to 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US &apos;s tax declaration from 2015 showed that at only USD 100 of their income was paid as wages , unlike most of the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ton divi@@ den@@ ds and income were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ ary , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years ago , intensified its funding together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Friday is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wel@@ fare Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dedicated to animal welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , making them much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the light@@ ness of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom is bur@@ sting with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air .
a breeze is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a thro@@ wer , which shoots a golden fire@@ work in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
town coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or unanim@@ ously decided : no ki@@ osk on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

the city council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the request for the construction of a sales ski@@ bus at the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine valley currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media insurrection after announc@@ ing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election since Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
he wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own Call Center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there &quot; shocked him &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more angry at the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee is quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ die @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
there is no need to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supposed demands of Arabian guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is located near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the short@@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ ke against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ants had seen gra@@ ff@@ iti on walls spra@@ yed against the temporary President Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been reli@@ eved of the office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian businesses on shops in the country has grown strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representative gave around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sought after : beverage market covered in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack has been carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed persons , who had embra@@ ced their faces , demanded the issu@@ ance of cash from the staff of the beverage market , and then fled at first by foot and then presumably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money was caught , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking area located opposite the parking space with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who has made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently need to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors on their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet area hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to rescue with the visit of the string zoo .
on the other hand to Mul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group was delighted at the Deep Sea in Mul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to the jump , swimming and planning .
children and car@@ ers were treated with their self @-@ prepared body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ speaking and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was used to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the voyage , the sun and the children and young people laugh@@ ed at home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the go on a four day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were met .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all mini@@ stran@@ ts in a period of two years , the senior officials of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various places of pilgrimage have been examined and we finally decided to visit the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the open door of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt , made their way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved his wife and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and writing texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is went again and again to sing a song from a specially made pilgri@@ m song book together with crosses , chap@@ els or churches .
the par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided for a tasty and vigor@@ ating dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
on top of that , we stepped into the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then heard again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at Freiburg Min@@ ster and went through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow recorded the anchor that his coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself E@@ igen . the J@@ P made the legend proudly when he stor@@ med home to inv@@ ade a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ dri@@ er Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ du .
Ho@@ ys retirement has produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner played an Olympic @-@ ord in the qualification round , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ di was just behind after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ du drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys , there was evidence that after a weak start he was visi@@ bly wrong .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with all the UK flags at the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it &apos;s in the realm of the possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the World Record , who won Gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had disputed yesterday with officials before the qualification , when they called him function@@ aries to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which continues tomorrow and ends , Laura side@@ walks , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dr@@ amas played back in the background , so the res@@ ignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April was in the middle of S@@ esto and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ stran@@ fen , as well as the retirement of gre@@ ats such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you see the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt mill of Port@@ land due to dis@@ continuation of the energy supply question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are in the game , since the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby lifts all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt mill consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa finished the point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows years of spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have been in force starting in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of termination so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have entered into force from November this year even if there is still a statement guilty of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the potential closure of the Port@@ land melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land per year consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , and running at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a critical reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é story of almost every birthday tim@@ ec@@ ode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls participating in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking at it in April 2014 , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sales edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still se@@ eping through the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Ms J@@ en@@ ner - who is described as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though it applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers likes success not everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ y pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were back up again when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but on the m@@ ess around seems to pass by at the point .
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Centr@@ es show 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief offices are rejected annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry is focused on the impact of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ grown , are prepared for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey of the National Federation of Public Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the federal government &apos;s resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families that have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just@@ ly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the German government will cut the funding by 30 per cent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Secretary @-@ General and federal government and sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately susp@@ end these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need for legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal council centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of having report@@ edly attracted arms
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm to an employee while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Higher Regional Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i began to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and grab@@ bed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to do damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment was only two days after the Republi@@ can candidate triggered an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and weapons friends - should take measures if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge .
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign clearly revealed that the media would have ri@@ pped his words out of context , and that he would not fall into violence .
ordin@@ is Compl@@ aint requires compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tru@@ mp@@ s press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls at his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
during the upcoming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are distinguished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent , five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only paraly@@ zing the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 per cent again .
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
the Left came to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country tag .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens were again reluc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag ( 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country tag .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it is thus still lag@@ ging behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would , contrary to 2011 , miss the move .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a weight and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y .
in the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , lovers can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the West@@ er@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for the time standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax the Communic@@ ator could be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the phone could be folded up like a laptop .
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone segment of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and sold to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates providers that all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that &apos;s everyday for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphones in the world .
about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , were sold alone 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac world .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
the triumph of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen is now Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today each German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said just Jan@@ ina sphere , responsible for staff at the Siemens Board of Management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered to be a curse and a blessing .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of the enlargement of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question he asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion of fun growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs in both the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two bu@@ si@@ est cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion for private investment .
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s enlargement will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block@@ age are equal to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the encoding with regard to its advertising ads , in order to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the attractive open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has settled in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , employ some 200 million people of display blo@@ wers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung makes 84 percent of the adverti@@ sed Fac@@ ebooks .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a large share of revenues , so Facebook will show the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference Tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to get more control in people &apos;s hands .
woman on suspici@@ on of su@@ ici@@ dal suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning passed on a motorway at a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witness of the incident to sign up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers will not be held responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which one person was running in the dark on the motorway - was decided that drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killing a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street , took the court .
the Court found that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to a call -- was justified in a justi@@ fiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Cli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once li@@ vable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the history of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have demonstrated similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ gy atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years - was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gene , only a thick atmosphere left carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a slight co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately seek a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer I have thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , which it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the coach and vice president of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly coordinated with the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also has to have a right to make decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for the remuneration for North Sea Oil Workers are suspended , while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of discussion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start next year in order to restart the problems .
trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , fewer than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the cluster are rotating at different rates , and in what context the rot@@ ational periods with the planet formation stand .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest way .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these attacking stars rep@@ el large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more mas@@ si@@ lu@@ ous stars turn more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes as smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the con@@ stellation of the ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported detailed about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US Bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after its emotional release announcement , the 41 year old professional will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to be the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will be acting as consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old will nevertheless not be accepted into the reception hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was so successful - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field , its occurrence outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted , between 2001 and 2003 , forbidden ster@@ oids to have taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was banned for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect to have been receiving powerful funds from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could have done a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench often .
&quot; my job doesn &apos;t include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the conditions with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an ob@@ liter@@ ated ath@@ lete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become famous in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de has been proven that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Criminal Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en had to participate in the courses over 50 m of free style .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) has requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news po@@ urs through the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act in the forbidden substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should already have had a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the ath@@ lete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ charged nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier than his brother Tom@@ as@@ z .
both test the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , Dan@@ ek@@ ova &apos;s case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the whole Russian team except for systematic dop@@ ing the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous clubs in China had also taken care of violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of free style , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Sun stood at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ as@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock .

according to a recent survey by malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , in part multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the deletion fees requested by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to earn ran@@ som is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was quickly done over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it sel@@ ects deliberately altered files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher is the damage when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpetr@@ ators &quot; demand in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service to get more money .
they declare to their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites , or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for example files .
and if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must partly negotiate and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ma@@ sts are looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is done per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to f@@ end Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators already pursue new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpetr@@ ators rather thre@@ aten with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ conference &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top falls slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l in reverse back@@ rests available , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magic when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema seat and thus offer storage space , which is height up to 1.@@ 24 m from floor to ceiling .
the boot compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should , however , make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City @-@ emergency braking system ( working until Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and rot@@ ates speed when necessary .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped Top Diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : overthrow on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
as a liability is conceivable only in the case of dangers , typical of the air traffic , the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ar@@ gues ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a bend in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
cases of illness : when the Organ@@ izer pays
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is to be found without a doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was severely ill on the second day of its ger@@ mination vac@@ ations .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness led the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , allegedly poll@@ uted by sea@@ water .
the family believed that the journey was therefore lacking - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er experienced only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , after the violence committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have taken care of further attacks .
the state must be reck@@ oned and determined at the same time to react to terrorist acts .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country more quickly , however , security and strength are also the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals until the parliamentary elections 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is aimed at improving arms law so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much deb@@ ated duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with doctors , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a look at psych@@ ic things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister has clearly expressed itself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the char@@ coal @-@ makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter threw the minister to simul@@ ate with an ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of residence bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it looks regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that is to change : the legal remedy is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the ambient street every night when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ eler road exit .
drivers can then enter directly from Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : traffic is divided early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nervous the mot@@ ori@@ sts mostly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ stage goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler road .
from here , traffic is only guided in one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to take the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic will last will not be able to say the competent national enterprise .
however , it is worth to reck@@ on with years : because the bridge has an official residual use period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the pro@@ long@@ ation of the legal separation , the country has deliberately chosen the less traffic @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because with disabilities it is to be expected .
traffic will be run on the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural Tourism : cultural Offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima Association , 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the production in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke very little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the press release of the Young theater Münster .
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are invited to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugee figures , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has taken the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a das@@ h through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ sei@@ des belonging to the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one walks around for hours , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning is no longer thinking of sleep far from the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , board member of the German Society for slaugh@@ tering and sleeping medicine .
but the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in@@ som@@ nia , is an in@@ som@@ nia .
just being asleep , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the Board of Management of the German Medical Association with Practice in Var@@ el Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
it is not rare that the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
anyone who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , w@@ akes up every two or three hours and possibly begins to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , We@@ aving is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ aving .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , incomplete , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints like stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises We@@ aving .
this may investigate if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for example , for medical examination in the sleep laboratory , for example , for snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of sickness , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ ber explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the bonding , one goes to bed at his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a no@@ stri@@ l glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting bolts for a better sleep .
we@@ aving counts : regular sleeping and rising times , not lying too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night not at the watch - then one begins to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing lap of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he brought gold for the first time at the world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has presented himself in front of his former team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion will receive 20,000 € of award and a jungle king of € 15@@ 0,000 , no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming sports is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A for a certain period of time before WM / OS may not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ de from Bag@@ gage Check
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil engineers at the Düsseldorf police were able to capture two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suspect had made several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and bags of luggage as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 hrs civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to the polic@@ emen from past th@@ ef@@ ts of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were involved in community , labour @-@ raising and especially professional .
the specialists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ate 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves , who had entered Germany specifically for the off@@ setting of crimes committed in Germany .
they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between , a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like that , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed at the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in is called , will be bil@@ led with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator has been campaig@@ ning for a tough action of the police against the project , called the area as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks with official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who runs three children here , are above all anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the Hau@@ schild , they share the worry of rising r@@ ents and de@@ centr@@ alization .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who calls for a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police make up between the occup@@ ants and their neighbors , does not exist so clearly .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
also house occup@@ ations and the local residential projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the whole Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under great police orders in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the city has become a magnet for tourists and bal@@ lot liners from all over the world in recent years : with them , residents from GDR times and former house@@ keepers are now sharing their Kie@@ z .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on inserted discs or freshly painted facades , which have been thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury are according to statistics , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the criminal off@@ ences cause damages that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to be .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga .
for the one who studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Riga road - and stayed .
that is why it was also so important for the residents to get their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the Deut@@ ungsh@@ oh@@ eit about the district .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that the old residents are forced to re@@ press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - people living here are rather people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve of violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can be done if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn drawn over color bombs : the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z .
anyone who comes up should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub , can &apos;t complain about noise there .
all persons with pre@@ names have requested not to be named with their right names .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as contact for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who has a problem above all .
thus some - less ridi@@ culous than rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write out the place .
we were looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a wo@@ unding wool mil@@ ky sau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but administrative work is not its central area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports both honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new Container in Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must place the refugees in their own or rented rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
responsibility changes from the Land Registry Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find any private homes .
until now , it does not work , so it is necessary to rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes need to be intim@@ id@@ ated , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine Customer reports .
many work in the Bau@@ hof or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also jump in administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who eventually develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be useless , who will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the most recent events be afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer clearly states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What some people may call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also a topic for the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them into ob@@ itu@@ des completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so chief and volunteers must look out for activities locally and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
