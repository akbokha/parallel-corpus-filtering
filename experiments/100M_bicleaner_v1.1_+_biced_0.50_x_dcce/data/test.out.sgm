<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself lead with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are uncommon in terms of tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical contrast.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax his economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will have a massive return to regulation, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would increase for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in order to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost verbose." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teachers wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no party discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to further expand renewable energy with its investment program and demands: "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both, however, do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but rather to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should be paid better then, for example, for Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics think that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby who is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>

<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the area manager of Condrobs, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and among other things deals with the subject of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised dwellings for single-wing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has long been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be seen as inferior or abused in the worst case.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants to do this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be dirty and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper wrote that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable boldness showed that the head of state Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin condemned and accused Ankara to fall in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The transgression was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto will be difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first of all needs all the friends he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West since its reaction to the attempted seizure of power is considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued resentment on the snail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state leader in Ankara won a bonus to ensure that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this brilliant palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that are off the west and feel badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently given itself the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents of the press conference said they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired up Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state would at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his head of staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "IVANOV has been part of the tightest confidence group of Putin for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it reads that without giving reasons," "" "the discharge of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been a deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the director and staff leader of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest colleagues Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned upon his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So does the result of a kind of power struggle occur here?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president - would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say this very complicated post - you could almost say - trusting posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV participated in the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that after Putin's second term of office Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, closest ally, Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closure of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "", "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown presented a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the land.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering work of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, nearly 79% of the total deck at its place and the last section of the deck today gets a gong for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is a trendsetting high and low building.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection to the north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap to the north or the landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">My grandson, as the tolerances to which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been sued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later this resulted in a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation playing the game when it was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the average" "" "average" "" "person puts back each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, following the 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the game was launched, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "" "hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also rumors that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be made with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people in hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast became a multiplayer on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" -Manneskameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles turnt on the Swedish bar during the women's multi-combat event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-campaign title, and the fifth as she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey to an end at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as a unique athlete like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles won the last three years of sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between it and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged themselves after they won gold and silver in the longevity of women's solo campaigns at the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - included in their typical Tumbling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman during a school excursion into the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any competition competition, a series of victories that will stop as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture was deceiving.</seg>
<seg id="27">British beams and floor bulbs - in which Biles holds the title of the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She took up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and placed one on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them softly when they expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles shiny red, white and blue Eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old man-hood, which is called" "" "Oma" "" "by the Americans, had a ledge." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she fell to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi floods their shores and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National weather service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, told us that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were growing.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa would have requested ten thousand sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service reported that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the area of mobile.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the pre-locations near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these flowing rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still connected people from the floodwater in the districts Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that he would have warned him of another son who lives nearby.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and flocked in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency helpers would have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated up to Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flooding was" "" "spread quickly" "", "as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer moved near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was considerably absorbed by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfalls and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and classes in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWL CBS subsidiary reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa had 200 flood-flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals rinsed by flooding.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the commune of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flooding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part, who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last major flooding we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum from the city administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississipp, the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded, but on Friday they have not been reported until now.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, Manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," Townson said, "and it still comes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present at the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turneresses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female gymnasiums was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympiad of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gyastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for multiple campaigners.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but gymnastics in the whole country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to get it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "last five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have four female gymnastics in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner is primarily involved in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes, since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities uncountable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, offering a more powerful and easier accessible training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of Girl Power by holding the olympic team and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>

<seg id="11">Individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE proposal, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "when you get closer to you, you should turn around as a first, so that you can see your attacker and" "" "go out of the shot," "" "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then beat him with the knee into the crust and twist, while the attacker creeps before pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they judge the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, seize the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the attacker to the chest, then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and sausage-lex a serious test - taking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Prior to checking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing the rinsing-button of a pull-in toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical specialists about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he justified his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial period showed a luminometry number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometry number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a russian toilet which he refused to decline after their luminance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands were less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This is the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to check anything here, because it is in a disgusting place.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Vice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we carried out crazy brainstorming, ending that we said" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who directed the direction of the film, added:" "" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I had to lick him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that will be shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary informed that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, delivered a urine sample under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported by the team leader Kenias of the Doping Controllers.</seg>

<seg id="24">IOC member Richard Pound called for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russia's athletics.</seg>
<seg id="25">In doing so, it has been proven that in this type of sport a systematic and systematic thought has been made.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "in the Shakespeare-Jahr the Salzburg Festival presents the" "" "West Side Story" "" "with Tony and Maria as a portable love pair, similar to Romeo and Juliet." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">This is a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">The orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She is reminiscent of her love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it is wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is an enormous man.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his looks, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "for the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the" "" "West Side Story" "" "highly topical:" "" "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York and the New York residents didn't want them.</seg>

<seg id="3">They understood them in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year 2021.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid than so far, it's not: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that is the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electors, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the way Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are not local, so you are not allowed to choose the country tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems for this: during the holidays, helpers, the posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end voices, only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains in the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, you can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary silent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="19">She has twice invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to open documents; Merkel's parliamentary circuit lies in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything quite zag," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the remuneration of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of Behavior" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofandingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg also exists, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofandingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were some considerable complaints," "" "says Florian King, the deputy head manager responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachthroughput Street, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many scouts were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were in use in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not observed, the municipality encouraged the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue breakthroughs allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for which the refurbishment has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, holder of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers in Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such a generous deal was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars are now less frequent due to complicated transport.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his family climate is coming back at the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to comment, in order to sow it under the pseudonym Non-Allegrame men's middle ages with arduous insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed recovery of vinyl records is not due to a boom in Millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but also to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after at age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of Yougov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and savage wildly before I stand, hold my hands and say something like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic disk specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I am standing in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These vinyl records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, adding:" "" "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meet him meet the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who heard about the comeback and started buying their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "from the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record-revivals of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl record covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff member is flotting from a stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no turntable.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I'm looking for a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three men middle aged), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just recently came here and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead LP so that I can put them on the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I have no turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a lower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz groaned out of the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but standing psychic trauma is hard to imagine if one is standing next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window shopping as a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records..." "" "she drives with a dearded sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to mutate the pants in the jeans, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group who has more time and money than others, is also the one that most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they steer away from the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who raises over the shoulders of the middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to submit 72 provisional transactions in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional deals, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" "" "absolutely comprehensible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said the areas offer peaceful meetings between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the low-entry was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which was used non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years old are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals in the course of the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-th Rugby came to a abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the final hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Dee Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stitching, backing, line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medals of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad price of the silver medal - the fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't be that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan they lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and left the attacks of GBs off fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua showed a touch down in the right corner and 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vato Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still being taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinates, whose fans sang, flags pied and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged, and GB kicked off in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated in semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the bucks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-year-old team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotless gold than in those games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing down to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when they buried the second Olympic champion in a row without a tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39.th unslain deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more assistant than the trainer who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>

<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water-purpose association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was in the original on a part of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the Government of Lower Franconia dignified the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group charges" "" "Bavarian" "" "as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all that is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband for 31 years, 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the redevelopment of the flooding tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the realizations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there has always been new additions, because water is water and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Göll's faithful, reliable and correct service for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of heart blindness for his water-purpose association and he lived with the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for the reduction of nitrate in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">In his turn, Rupert Göller praised Water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water wart and he was a faithful pop-up.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well-building and the reorganization of the purpose-association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rupture at the Hochpot at Kirchlouder on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the high-tank of Pettstadt with tubes.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter who succeeds in the succession of Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens threatened by the branch of green energy are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the liberation of the renewable energy conversion at the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 per cent is applied.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on own electricity generation.</seg>

<seg id="18">Last year, the situation escalated further when the world's largest producer of producer China threw mass steel onto the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers present price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>

<seg id="21">On the one hand, imported import duties on import steel effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear is how sustainable price recovery is.</seg>

<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in teacher education she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors chorus.</seg>

<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular cohesion, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures in old age dissolve, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the pusts too quickly even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, Singen often has a special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generation, the common singing had a much higher significance, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Thanks to lyrics and especially melodies, people deny themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special achievement is required for the head, explained Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people, who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something long, I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks not having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a tone goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the familiar circle in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who likes singing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="6">The State Department is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">At about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday evening in a bump of two bombs.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman killed and about 20 people were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two leaps went up again, and a further person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">The detonation near the seaside resort Patong popular for holidaymakers was injured by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">At Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded which killed a city clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives set out in a flower beet in front of the Revier of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, Detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called several wounded.</seg>

<seg id="18">It is too early to express itself to possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be in connection with the Islamist insurgency movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were placed.</seg>

<seg id="24">Still be unclear which group stole behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials all over the country to increase security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "after the well-term bombings, the Austrian State Department recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities." ""</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no necessary travel to these provinces." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were only a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits great influence to the military in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-cha-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to penalize chaos, while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody turmoil, considers himself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the revolting uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Less than a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl 3,44 instead of 2,10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.3 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will rise again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf is then at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the municipal council of Kulmbach established that for these wastewater facilities, undercover was reported.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to the legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed to the Board, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewerage facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that there are relatively small facilities in all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water fall, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the volume of sewage in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, not least because of their age, refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable scale.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be recovered from the ground and in the pond treatment plant Lopp, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be extended, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system could be installed in order to comply with the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "for these extraordinary expenses, continued care and maintenance costs which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the case of low sewerage in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance" "" "fully hit" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein picture.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All faulty entries arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Blackface or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat communicated that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company had an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of infringing clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was" "" "vulnerable and unpleasantly" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the falling extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tribunals.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats a large audience of young people - who are more diversed in the race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snapchats filters an image that is offensive for a user," "" "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case earlier," "" "said the 25 year old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsified ISIS intelligence service information, establishes committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel from the United States Central Command modified intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it permitted the actual conditions on the spot to report a congress of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Republican Committee, Intelligence Committee and military budget commites, reports of great discontent at Central Command secret services, which reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, typically enjoyed by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The management mistakes in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their laws, an optimistic picture of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom has publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command revised the intelligence reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after it was added that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge as the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Defense Department.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments at ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest-level democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, such as Mr. ship," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "foams morality among analysts and" "" "gave too little space for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. ship and the democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House in the Centcom analysts with regard to a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the congress were published Tuesday through" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were recorded for complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigation of the general inspector is still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcomed a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful aircampaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year, however, have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of divisions of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the former government under George W. Bush presented only a small occupation force in Iraq, and little time disappeared about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current media coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to provide government agencies that contrary to the government statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as these provisional refineries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This realization, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after firing three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch, which will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered an astonishing vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 seats at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the entrance door in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept playing from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and loaded the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling constant and inevitable, a furious relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is served by the wristband to become a triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leapy or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names, which are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade there are the sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was perceived so sparsely that many people I had surveyed did not know that it was even an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider-charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist tremor of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and need a series of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to the execution, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists hope to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the television broadcast also another great goal: those of the world or the Olympic-ord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel somewhat tired when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, moves up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear-monkey and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US-Turner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new fans after air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demanding political changes in Ethiopia, met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that umpteen protesters were killed during clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed eighty unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader in the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy was expanding at a considerable rate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except protest, it breaks off," "" "said Seyoum Tesla, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were forced more or less in recent years, could use turmoil and arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of getting worse under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate over Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian strongholds from Eththopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat land areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the intelligence agencies, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly proficient in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and render them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray area of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he is not enjoying the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was experiencing such an upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which according to information provided by analysts seemed to be slipped by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misunderstanding of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, run by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests in the U.S. and other Western allies bring about a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, fearing that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republican, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow workers trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump called upon the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastically.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the Conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt would help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down upon Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to Michigan's economic situation this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course, I thought it was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic frontiers in politics and then to rest as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to how the reaction falls." Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corroborated tone as his demand values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leader in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while focusing on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocally his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, to the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true, in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hinterbänkler, completely false, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama served Mrs. Clinton as an external minister, allowed ISIS to spread out by signing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of sitting on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, twilight" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps apologies as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a notorious café in Williamsburg, in which one could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but for 15 years served a good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were displaced from his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The soap shop Soap Cherie, who replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous people robbed it as the last loss in a gentrified city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still cannot believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel except and verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it's also a re-invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He began working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide funds for a new job, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>

<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haarks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates at a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-term lifestyle, however, seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed for a long time that Greenland will become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-haie is hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">She measured her slow motion when she stationed six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbones of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadaver who tortured from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland haie, who brought fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This center of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons testing larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons trying to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland haarks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens-core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark-females can only get offspring if they are longer than four metres, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-haarks with the multiplication apparently leave at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck stuck a 120-year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often especially big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal sheds heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the go on a four day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were met.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all ministrants in a period of two years, the senior officials of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various places of pilgrimage have been examined and we finally decided to visit the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the open door of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt, made their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where a Münster Unserer loved his wife and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and writing texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis went again and again to sing a song from a specially made pilgrim song book together with crosses, chapels or churches.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parishioners of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided for a tasty and vigorating dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">On top of that, we stepped into the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be lowered and then heard again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy the Minis met in the later afternoon at Freiburg Minster and went through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow recorded the anchor that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself Eigen. the JP made the legend proudly when he stormed home to invade a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Andrier Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement has produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man in whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner played an Olympic-ord in the qualification round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindi was just behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hindu drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was simply unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kenny's and Hoys, there was evidence that after a weak start he was visibly wrong.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels with all the UK flags at the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We came together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it's in the realm of the possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint, which will start today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record, who won Gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had disputed yesterday with officials before the qualification, when they called him functionaries to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which continues tomorrow and ends, Laura sidewalks, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong railway cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played back in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April was in the middle of Sesto and Mobbingvorstranfen, as well as the retirement of greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you see the first evening of competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we already have 10,000 new apprenticeships, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network.</seg>

<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle between the attractive open source community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to host life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>

<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the cluster are rotating at different rates, and in what context the rotational periods with the planet formation stand.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping sample, Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An obliterated athlete had won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become famous in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre obstacle course in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested in Brazil and excluded.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven that is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Criminal Court (CAS) confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen had to participate in the courses over 50 m of free style.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail chipper her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, in part multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the deletion fees requested by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to earn ransom is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was quickly done over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it selects deliberately altered files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher is the damage when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demand in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the investigators of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare to their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred Euros, companies must partly negotiate and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building box to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmasts are looking for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to fend Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators rather threaten with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing problems," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "at the" "" "Hackerconference" "", "the security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>

<seg id="2">It looks regularly on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the legal remedy is to be extended.</seg>

<seg id="5">The road construction will be extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler road exit.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around for hours, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning is no longer thinking of sleep far from the wake-up ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaving, board member of the German Society for slaughtering and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">But the insomnia, that is, an insomnia, is an insomnia.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just being asleep, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Management of the German Medical Association with Practice in Varel Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is not rare that the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly frequent in depression," "" "says Weaving." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Anyone who has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wakes up every two or three hours and possibly begins to pondering about everyday problems and worries, Weaving is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, advises Weaving.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, incomplete, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weaving.</seg>
<seg id="24">This may investigate if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for medical examination in the sleep laboratory, for example, for snoring with breathing exercises, in case of sickness, sleep transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fiber explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now, the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler has presented himself in front of his former team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic Champion will receive 20,000 €of award and a jungle king of €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals," "" "wrote the 26-year-old at night on his Facebook page." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between, a rest of cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like that, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolad.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed at the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which is to be torn down soon, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments is to be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the real estate company Friedrichshain is called, will be billed with burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator has been campaigning for a tough action of the police against the project, called the area as" "" "no-go-zone" "" "for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks with official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew members on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers were commissioned by the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves vorm Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are above all annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the Hauschild, they share the worry of rising rents and decentralization.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who calls for a majority of police protection from vandaliating leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police make up between the occupants and their neighbors, does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the local residential projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the whole Mainzer street very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under great police orders in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the city has become a magnet for tourists and ballot liners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former housekeepers are now sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on inserted discs or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are according to statistics, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the criminal offences cause damages that tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the one who studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga road - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important for the residents to get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the Deutungshoheit about the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former mosquitoes that the old residents are forced to repress.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many - people living here are rather people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve of violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can be done if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn drawn over color bombs: the house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Anyone who comes up should be aware of this - just like someone who runs into a pub, can't complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as contact for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>

<seg id="10">"" "" "" "but administrative work is not its central area," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine's customer that Annika Deuschle supports both honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New Container in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in their own or rented rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the Land Registry Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work, so it is necessary to rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common homes need to be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance for refugees and migrants who have to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine Customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also jump in administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who eventually develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, do not work, and be useless, who will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problem cases," "" "customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing works at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the most recent events be afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer clearly states," "" "What some people may call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also a topic for the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins bring them into obitudes completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So chief and volunteers must look out for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes clear that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
