Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and is accused of Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iran nuclear program promoted by Obama has further deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress who was part of an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the pending election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was ch@@ ained on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to school , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emer@@ gen@@ cies sometime after@@ ward .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took life when the police arrived .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motiv@@ ating .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had been so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of education .
one of the long @-@ term friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the Black Forest at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was okay .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed at the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had ended Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica player in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commemor@@ ative ceremony on Tuesday evening .
Sch@@ mid@@ t &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ awake , singing &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now tells us that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call was Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arcade length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN boss says there &apos;s no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that Russia &apos;s response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the meeting of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the opportunities of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s endurance and start to run their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early countries .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good idea of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; happy &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they are &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio , with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans regards Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters belonging to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mog@@ ul is the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pre @-@ selection state of the nation , the state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ law , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six of 10 In@@ depend@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet .
this is a change since the time four of ten of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , there is evidence that a large number of GO@@ P voters regard the Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ si@@ bly .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another Candi@@ date , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while anti @-@ trust support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp re@@ aps the majority support .
he is ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters who support Tru@@ mp say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration questions .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do as well .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs up to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ tags survey by ABC / Post , they prefer to out@@ sider a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential areas
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea region .
in the street a square meter of a Re@@ et@@ dach@@ haus costs € 7@@ 3.@@ 300 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , one of the price comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and dol
double Tor@@ cher in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pir@@ ates - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to rub@@ b@@ ish double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol matches ( 8@@ 9th ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third start .
Müller received good help from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto during his 28 @-@ year hit in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ leadership .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six home games in the royal class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive endeav@@ ours .
the attacks have often been initiated on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely happened to the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown defeated the Polish head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , which Tor@@ wart Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus could set a needle stick .
at Tor@@ hü@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was forgiveness .
for example , when he had a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a square with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back to the Ka@@ der after muscular problems , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports present@@ er Matthias Sam@@ mer on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of scattered Bavaria fans had apparently provoked the supporters of host pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was transported out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Potsdam long @-@ term study close .
good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute of Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers risk losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val inflammation in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the risk of endanger@@ ing sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also results in good dental health up to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by too@@ th@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking would increase the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pin the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ h@@ ander
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as an expert for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third construction section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , the arch@@ e@@ ologists have now been found .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
beside the rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to improve the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement ( TT@@ IP ) .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between the corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way works significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the competent EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de recently introduced the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely indicated that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
so far the proceedings cont@@ ested with each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work on an international investment court according to their own data .
there could , for instance , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially requested by large corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel read@@ just@@ ment , where companies can test damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act highlighted the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was above all critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a major advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission included key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked in spring with other EU ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart that the shy @-@ looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative one .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states should follow in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and anticip@@ ates positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nationwide polished masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing of ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album desc@@ ends into the American Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in any record list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after highly productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic fragments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth regular studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller clubs got out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the dark room Hamburg more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is heard from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one en@@ core thanks St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s modest , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and eventually bows down under the ro@@ aring appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s research
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited since his election in the Prime Minister &apos;s research .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s new president , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s inquiry and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could skip a few sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commemor@@ ative ceremony celebrating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several title stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appeal to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ ack@@ able within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are making changes in order to remove the whole idea of limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he has been T@@ ory leader over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader who promised another policy approach says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the strike with ad@@ hooks , and instead of focusing on serious problems like poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not take part - for example , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally took the word and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch of Jud@@ y &quot; that is often associated with the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was seen with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply according to data , showing an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller building target .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made assessments of the time of an increase in interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index graduated with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20 % jump after taking over of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ at@@ ar .
troubles@@ ome 21 years young , a hanging with a sli@@ pper@@ y rise .
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more even more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 spins .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Rud@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
including E@@ wa and Vi@@ kt@@ oria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ damer Platz .
the bending construction : here you find I@@ dol , whose posters hang up in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ in , since Monday evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa in half a year deserves .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ kt@@ oria had to sit in the 10th grade in high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans do not .
also Ben@@ ding itself does not .
he has taken care of anyway .
for the advertising in the promotional break of the Super@@ car he cas@@ u@@ ded three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company r@@ ins@@ ed many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , bending is also cas@@ c@@ aded .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one marv@@ els at the window pane .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that in the US and the UK , however , with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1st place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of Pot@@ ato
potatoes or D@@ twe@@ eter ?
this is both - and in the potato min@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of the twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen in television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a bar@@ be@@ que is turned in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has now been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and as much potatoes of the sk@@ ewer , al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash starts anti @-@ ageing campaign to fight Al@@ di
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a soil recognition campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million dollar al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA by mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron manufacturers S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash publishes more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual investors strategy day .
it is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts such as Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets , and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in the next year in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost some 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business cycle by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told him that met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash would disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly react to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the reduction of operating debt with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops by fast growing fresh food and delivering a better range of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop san@@ itation programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ burg and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp was rail@@ ing a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty jeal@@ ous about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a fight , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account C@@ yrene &apos;s decision on Friday , which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part in the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely concentrated on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick quickly made the way to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ramp , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants accum@@ ulating in a man &apos;s land and re@@ acting Serbian officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the states and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants kno@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some meadows returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ Block at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece in the past . they expressed their hope that , finally , the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a bel@@ ated action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency meeting launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning a bar@@ bed wire fence along his border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after stopping a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were employed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are searching for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , expected next week , but re@@ porters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ setting crimes under the new laws .
authorities are willing to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos gave the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get involved .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway @-@ connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are only back here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the elections in the country say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six percent would not support them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited especially by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that Clinton is supporting Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about its top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that a woman &apos;s president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ visi@@ veness are also cited .
since the vice @-@ president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the elections are asked who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by Clin@@ ton &apos;s tra@@ ilers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ ander .
if Bi@@ den decides not to compete for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will increase before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call upon the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the elections is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best inter@@ sec@@ ting with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and server will continue to be set up as an external minister , most Democratic voters are pleased with their statement of the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one @-@ third is content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinions have deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters overall : only 32 percent regard them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of voters do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of voters throughout the country view Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp however receive good notes on tour .
of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the preliminary elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is next to Donald Tru@@ mp at the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new pol@@ l , and others are losing hold of a dramatic halt .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot 6 % in the same period to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and Tru@@ mp is sur@@ passing Tru@@ mp on Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tru@@ mp well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even more hot water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ newcom@@ ers
nearly two years after a student died during a schi@@ kan@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons are filed .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , told the police .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment due to murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned this - officially or officially - we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a raise of interest comes , and the house will be sha@@ ken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore representatives of the US central bank stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could , however , find that the whole excitement was perhaps exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal levels , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets income will be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German Bank analysts in a more recent study on what happens after tax hikes of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six months past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis that published Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increases cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which could not exist before and that could accelerate the recession .
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest increases since 1950 only had nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the results of the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases with such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants spent the whole year on an increase in interest of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months until now .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for stocks when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond endi@@ ces immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; highly @-@ consuming bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has increased , the income curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in the large and whole company , companies that will un@@ wind the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Council Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ du@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Parliament member and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously @-@ called examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I think too important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that harder work must be made to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to get the commercial ri@@ vals to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins seized The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a special BBC fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when it &apos;s the next time an entertainment series star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the commission pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales were slow@@ ing down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly see that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for failing sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the purchaser fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 in spending was spent more than 1 £ online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now done via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion labels in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family will be sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ vements C@@ emetery .
the funeral procession passed over to the Holy Place , where only days ago a construction crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king left a sanc@@ tion against the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 star@@ ters who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to stop when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company would be banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man praised what was causing the down@@ fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed to a courtyard of the great mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ als ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ people is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly hire craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q points across the country
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can use a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , according to the company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at arti@@ sans and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must move this more strongly to balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in the half @-@ year profit and the turnover after the Group was ow@@ ning the costs of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , has 200 new stores open .
function@@ ary of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and indul@@ gence .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed out that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were funds of club accounts of which they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is handled with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was the Chairman of the Sho@@ op@@ ener Senate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that no asset was created at any point in time .
the sports officials had only calculated allow@@ ances and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ based chief firm of the finance office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have required money to secure our life insurance as a security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , you can only make no debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success , the payout of allow@@ ance payments had been decided retro@@ actively by 1991 .
therefore one part of the allow@@ ances was paid only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detailed calculations seemed to be possible , the former ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and divisions managed the two defend@@ ants together , the second defend@@ ant said .
why the out@@ flow of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial services , but it is important that debt has been free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of an official investigation of official abuse , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that was , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage indem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why indem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
on top of that , the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to di@@ ets , he has taken into account the club 1.000 Euro per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to present exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept up after an operation examination , in which all had been judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all deport@@ ations have been made in cash , so that he must go to the bank of Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction for three years , the Compu@@ Stra@@ it will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs during the company &apos;s spl@@ itting process .
the positions at the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut down 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company shared on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around € 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of fiscal 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard share accounted for 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the end .
in the third quarter of July the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues declined in 15 of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more shops online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan envis@@ ages the reduction of some 5@@ 5.000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting action in Iraq would be largely rejected : 54 per cent said , 35 per cent said to agree .
61 percent are positive that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
on the other hand , 24 percent are in conflict with the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees launched .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had been formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ thro@@ wer .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials stopped pe@@ pper@@ y at first .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now been waiting a little back .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees packed together and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates at the current level will last from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest placed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , director of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications suggest that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death guards at the Delta State University left for an ap@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , He has shot on a man , and has killed anyone .
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police came into the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb passed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; No information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years , described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb has called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb ro@@ de his car to the side , fled walking , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb has received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had a few stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
with the pilot trade union , however , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings &apos;s low @-@ cost airline .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger &apos;s business .
the Euro@@ wings cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the board of CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday after the strike stopped .
that divided the union .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement rules for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve profitable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline in recent months has led to various strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competi@@ tor routes , Lufthansa looks at the company &apos;s own cheap line Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external defender to the weeping and exclu@@ des him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bone frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be postpon@@ ed tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I &apos;m coming back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the UK @-@ Defense has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad at that . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron has better known The Lor@@ ax ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take too long before you know it .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ abel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , re@@ stores a content of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , as the local environment is rav@@ aged by the monetary gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ tering , Th@@ read stri@@ ck@@ ering Once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that Britain has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a downward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
message @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyse .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully gets further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not bring such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set Jonathan side@@ ways in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and receive four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred inst@@ al@@ ments and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with the above .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar pause against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy by 2017 is in a wake @-@ up
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equ@@ alled ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which sharply fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and does not always have its own debt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided on its annual meeting that it does not like it if they thre@@ aten social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes an out@@ looking Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long har@@ dening like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a sol@@ itary force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break down a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan useful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the 2017 &apos;s referendum campaign to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who have made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his ins@@ anity Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door .
the press never did it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed more for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I just press it friendly - in development .
he says we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ eb@@ ar@@ b tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ y &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ men may well say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight for &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the moving bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours in support in the refer@@ ral campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ity to the EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reached the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received in advance by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the BM@@ J claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ a year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in tough controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least pay for its production on programs that other do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a premium time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I would like to see how this should be public television .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how to sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; niche programmes &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where they can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their seem@@ ing missions for the justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified in front of the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission , to inform , form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio - and they should take a look at the public TV channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform , clarify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and enter alliances with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des shift the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound bul@@ lets .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have to be heard with sound stim@@ uli that have too high frequencies for human hearing .
the impulses work through switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ wind and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain by an optical fiber , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily suscep@@ tible human neur@@ ons to make the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stations and subway trains and require a second look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R from 15 to 18 September ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Dock@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which converts to the image of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Ban@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped to distribute in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of domestic keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet is achieved . &quot;

one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists turn to work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters gre@@ ets the commu@@ ter to the subway .
the Am@@ nesty International was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist who works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed by the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire - by a legend of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a realistic twi@@ light corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ff with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors will disappear fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se s@@ miles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces reaches from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burned on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers .
let people go .
people often turn into drinks recipes , film night venues and community meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and break their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember to start your university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll @-@ culture that can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for anyone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in cultivation allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I &apos;ve consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him an SMS rather than kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on people &apos;s doors is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people falling asleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a balanced deal as my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the saying .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it makes them a little qui@@ eter for them , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before leaving her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally turn into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take part in them , get rid of them , and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they bring together all the common friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an el@@ m and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never def@@ rost the room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the hel@@ per . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build a good deal today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner wants to know how quickly a convenient living room can be created : he is building terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people are left to a large extent here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need sufficient living space for the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be adapted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I passed my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , it always makes the threatening D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the towns there is no place for this .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but they were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message stating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the simpli@@ fication of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may turn off half@@ way and this could lead to a abor@@ tion of the update .

you should also make sure that before your download you have seen our check@@ list of all things to prevent things wrong and protect themselves if they do so . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .

N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup leader stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore on this Sunday of title defender and double champion Hamilton .

whether the current smoke in the city state will have an impact on Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation to the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot bring the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .

district office is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ markt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the clo@@ ak of the Social Foundation and opened a new office at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides advice you can also participate in courses .
the Social Foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health care insurance or health care insurance .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also no shortage of services for insurance companies because the complexity of insurance companies is scar@@ c@@ ely understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center see both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure essential for the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the unification of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and this invite you to a regular social gathering . &quot;
with this , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus was told on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus will lose an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was stated in the broadcast .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg ( Vienna Hof@@ burg ) and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
park penalty : Tim meadow thro@@ ws polic@@ ew@@ oman with money

foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , Ex @-@ nationality @-@ keeper in Germany and near Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim was engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not ins@@ ist intellec@@ tually .
meadow had just cut the hair@@ s in the heart of Bremen when he saw how outside a car park guard exhibited a p@@ uni@@ per for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; meadow rus@@ hed out of the store , insul@@ ted the officials and threw down her due financial penalty , as reported in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be shown , or not .

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , following the police told his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young man and struck him with his fist .
the victim was suffering from a nas@@ al bone frac@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and went there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
under the aid of a head@@ stock , one examined the victim &apos;s face and th@@ igh@@ s .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
until now there is only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police as@@ signs witnesses and exec@@ ut@@ ors to report under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen .
the mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice Fel@@ steal on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus was met years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their professional training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it was , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and guide the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ er bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in frac@@ tal @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ fold father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a leading emergency physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of frac@@ tal @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ess@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ tin ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 Euros will be given by the mill@@ er as part of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the local municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ess@@ ausen .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
who visits garbage &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rim .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sti@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly after the long time already sen@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are going high on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , not even beyond the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians too wants to un@@ abri@@ dged his borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government told , the first refugees had already tried to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in the night hours to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles ever met with new refugees ever since .
it is mainly Sy@@ rer and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the days ahead , his country will reck@@ on with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to make people wise to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary was admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed result in the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister East o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees with appropriate plans for potential exceptions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call it details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners provide a good testimony to the country since then , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was still trying to calm him on Wednesday morning in Hor@@ gos . he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be very high refugee numbers at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to publicly disclose himself to the boards , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still ha@@ iry with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped many people to open themselves .
an app@@ rais@@ al that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ da divi@@ des .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with a personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce sought for volunteers by calling an honorary official , she immediately reported to him and was involved in the establishment in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and clubs allows training as well as further training and supervision of the mour@@ ning and mour@@ ners .
every two years training for new employees is offered .
the panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
also there , further personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Res@@ ult Mix@@ ed , Finance prospects reduced for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the Supply @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his chances of winning for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wishes to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share amounted to over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ unces to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in earlier forecast .
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect comes despite the price increases aver@@ aging 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nevertheless expected that the result was increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will acquire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , above all in production and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday jobs were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the st@@ acks asked analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ ging transport increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labor cost in the cargo business .
in the pre @-@ market trading , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 US $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent less than a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey seat of the seat there is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation against all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising interest in federal bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest rates this week .
however , the financial markets wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow , promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets , because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and in early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the sentence was expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now around 10 % below the May High level .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred over the past few weeks , it would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically during their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ acting on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnis@@ he , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts und@@ one .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a serious crisis as in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement in the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest , because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale trading market , which is also sold to the general public .
yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .

there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole shop makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express for you .
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the box and has different taking options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 L@@ oos .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande supports diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to explain shock@@ ing women about how important good nutrition is during breast @-@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics building on Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council meeting , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the committee had decided to apply for a construction legislative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the current development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permission for a special form regarding the roof structure was permitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ conve@@ x first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which was prescribed for energy reasons - unlike the development plan - was to be below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inclin@@ ation did not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - although the Bern@@ ese municipal council usually drives restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs amount to around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sport promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the Land Registry Office .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the University of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to get to Sch@@ ong@@ au is to be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the altern@@ ation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over leadership from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in every case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi move to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as chief doctor for more than 30 years , have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .

Jag@@ dun@@ ken with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use as the police notified .
after a shot , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered grave injuries and were put into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police are determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crime
a suspect has led the police to the bodies of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also noted on Tuesday evening , is also considered to be susp@@ icious , who , according to the statement , had given the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the location of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met his victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing people there was finally a suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities said that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and placed the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay down the burden for him .
the investigation of the near@@ er circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need lod@@ gings : study warns of housing gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution competitions on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
in this way 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first reception .
many come across the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in not@@ penet@@ rated WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be wai@@ ved by the tax tax and the basic tax applied to subsidi@@ zed residential flats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , tax@@ able depreci@@ ation facilities are needed according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros were rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be st@@ acked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia direct corridor
after Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia .
Zagreb An@@ no@@ unces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is nevertheless dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sh@@ ot@@ ting of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , are also virtually eliminating the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of the media reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border f@@ ences .
there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance must now quickly create a secure passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees following the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before closing on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws pro@@ str@@ ate the overcoming and damage of the border z@@ a@@ us as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threat sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; border , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it .
they gathered the garbage which had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier gri@@ ds were broken down and one of the record wareh@@ ouses in the limit location was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself as the aim of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to travel to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had un@@ expect@@ edly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s closure , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and br@@ anded the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had only ta@@ sted the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with a snack and a drink .
we said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very happy to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were switched to a regional train in W@@ els in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to try again after the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still over the border .
the regional train was shut down before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ piece run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further Z@@ ig@@ ,000 to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures in order to guarantee humanity , our German Chancellor has officially highlighted the Hungarian government &apos;s position in the Dun@@ n of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for people seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
with the support of refugees , Konrad has all hands full to do .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up districts for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in the first visit centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ian year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating torture for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ mandate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that the district don@@ ors have to observe a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the upper duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , is more successful with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older Lord , whom one does not say without any doubt in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not bear the costs of the Republic as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
his own search for quot@@ a has not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons affected can be accommodated without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
but for emer@@ gen@@ cies other locations should be tested for their suitability .
criticism of the city chief on the distribution of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has put on further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the appropriate border controls .
for the time being there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the seek@@ ers would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls to its borders is a logical consequence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neues Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is covered , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the clever minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the New ship@@ yard and later also to acquire what to acquire .
already from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown into a further business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop compared to the shop in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets starting from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
prior to that , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were fascinated by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get in rap@@ tures when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag will enhance any outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a village whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign language , concerns journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischer K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fresh@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ town is related to it via -@@ zig @-@ corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ urban@@ ist Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become a mighty man of the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous jumps , to which besides Tru@@ mp the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit a big mas@@ onry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to whom the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he had once been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ hah was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so angry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ers Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family sp@@ ends something for the church organ during a visit , which generally arrived well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine this from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the Sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12 000 cin@@ emat@@ ograph@@ ers , even in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for smooth tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpine Club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at least 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership during the Today Show
Charles Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the Today ratings .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number has remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months .
in August Today achieved an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now , sunrise has an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change are more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , yiel@@ ded 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that did not manage to out@@ source the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who eventually ended Sam Wood in The bach@@ el@@ or , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows on the day before being out of three , you may have acci@@ dentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could their answers become a game @-@ destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay was the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten .

but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coaches would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ ka as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first p@@ unt @-@ return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist teams co @-@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .

it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn sage in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get clubs in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters is conven@@ ing until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ j@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as there was during the war in Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ j@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistently : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need Germany &apos;s uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics in the city of Germany should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus , &quot; in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ um intermediate level of three to four years is tested .
but that is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ ere Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a long @-@ distance and nervous system of trade .
only in the afternoon was a firm pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction that ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

solid profits also earned the London and Paris trade stations .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index was last about 1 percent in the plus .
many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the big decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday .
the debate about the load from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E down to record low and left deep marks even at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investment in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold than in the same period in the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the ru@@ pe@@ e district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Managing Director , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before returning to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bodies , known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as a less mort@@ al alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post shall be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and living - concrete offers are not yet available .
Em@@ den - The City of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and housing .
it is waiting for appropriate offers , that is to say it on the part of the city .
which investor demand is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already bought a few months ago and let the buildings be torn down on it .
H@@ ieve project : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday house on the small sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ gli@@ ons are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was negotiated , gri@@ mm@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday house on the small sea close Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized em@@ blem company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end headed off from the system @-@ construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately ten to twelve million euros expensive project has been in discussion for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , marine owner and board member responsible for the interests of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cla@@ p that overlooks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all buses have to come so that it is reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches Double @-@ Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n that will raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees over@@ roll by the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / could be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mort@@ ality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ v@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach cancer - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under which underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease dissolved completely and at 28 % partially .
in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison , the diabetes was completely dissolved in one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease mort@@ ality in five years , according to the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger out@@ ages in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tested conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is becoming increasingly popular in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually , we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader needed to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mitt@@ edly admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to care for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions like a true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence , and this provoked unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ o control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low alcoholic drinks , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age were reporting the poison control centers , of 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink dis@@ infection while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young@@ sters drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft oral water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the broad@@ ca@@ ster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go of si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four spra@@ yers from straw@@ berry frag@@ rant &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
your blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had kno@@ cked his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection books and store hands dis@@ infection agents outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ infection agents containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities believe that the product contains meth@@ anol , a fatal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by issuing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ infection agents and ban@@ ishes them out of their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and refer@@ enced disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a rear @-@ end collision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ mes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver has been injured slightly .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the trans@@ verse p@@ liers towards the industrial area in the direction of the industrial area , and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
damage to the accident involved in accidents caused damage of about 10,000 euros , shares the police with them .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed off .
sm@@ ells : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk of dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again .
Hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA because of N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and War@@ bur@@ ton should be careful in January @-@ re@@ mitt@@ ance , which could destroy the unity of the cad@@ re .
ons increase guide over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time Aber@@ deen gave a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the d@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismissed spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under elevated control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch tobacco guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers Middle Field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , and Dei@@ la swe@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who is now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this just like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously during January transfers
despite his comments , just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he ha@@ st@@ ened some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious at the signing of new entran@@ ts and insist@@ ed that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic @-@ Dest@@ ination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ u with referring card &quot; &quot; &quot;
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pl@@ agu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome an@@ kles for two years and did not manage the Wales finish this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts were 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was removed later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have commented on no performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rup@@ tible Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident happened in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s sure to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insist@@ ed that the board of Dun@@ dee United has still confidence in the management team to turn things down - but is , however , that the decline in the field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory , which gave them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won all , in poker games or le@@ agues that won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it is rising altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the period of May to July , unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the figures of the National Statistics Office ( O@@ NS ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken anno@@ yed the process
as the security personnel could not manage the situation , the police called the police .
only with the use of pe@@ pper@@ y spray the officers could take the stor@@ ks in custody .
a breathing alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pro@@ mil@@ le and first stayed in custody .
why I will be witn@@ essing an exile in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may be allowed to see directions in the US , and as often more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ ic lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma charged me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have better form@@ ulate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a representative of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution hunt persu@@ aded to get out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
a man of Per@@ th &apos;s attempt to depend on the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed on Tuesday to a demoli@@ tion incident in Pel@@ vic .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt T@@ up@@ a test near Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on its stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I am going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Fru@@ str@@ ations levels of the trainer have been set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known through his preparation of the beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ its , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it would have been like this all day , which was also so .
but it had so much on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after the driver &apos;s flight arrested

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals for claims on ring struggles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely veiled comment to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his team and said they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches on his team made him feel confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talks about ring @-@ fights , when she kno@@ cked us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not getting used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like them .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters was a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and don &apos;t have any points at all ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team fre@@ es this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who may possibly have a lifel@@ ong penalty due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled into Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Cafe Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long penalty for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the official explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ref@@ uses to leave his Australian and Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and stops at an initial block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
on Tuesday evening , a truck driver had seriously injured a truck accident with three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police told me .
the driver &apos;s house of the accident cause demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when it was asleep , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping cock .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; Educ@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure them .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the Register of sexual crimes , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael blur@@ red the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was given deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added before the date of judgment to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
bad user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn along the river border Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot across bridges and du@@ sts to the German side .
they will be picked up by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the beginning of the week , more refugees arrived at the Munich Main Railway Station in comparison to the beginning of the week .
there were around 700 people in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 pm , a spokes@@ man in the morning said .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of a storm in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with bows from 60 to 90 hour kilometers to calculate .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all moving among the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations were accounted for in this segment by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is reflected in the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not going to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen feature further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA with new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan feeder wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , however , there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA .
outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n rack mounted hand at the front panel : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was primarily moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the f@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice Department of Justice Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the parties can even hope for money if they were confined to tight spaces within a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , was now on his free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
due to the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin , he failed .
but the constitu@@ tion@@ ers raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for the re @-@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive for the compensation , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disgu@@ ise of the protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitu@@ ents have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they spoke only in April to a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages , because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommodated between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines because of missing staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rising , even to blows it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial black@@ mail , 21 vac@@ ancies in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to accept a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to a number of forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental objects is dramatic : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for asylum seek@@ ers .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 80 000 social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists and federal government ministers agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migrant scientist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resident obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view of the labour market is generally enforced , so that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often given by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore based on the view from Thr@@ u@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg for work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ rooted parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ pieces in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators increase significantly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity , for example , by allowing more technical colle@@ ges .
in the countries students are prepared without knowledge of German language in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by educated teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ offers from the Berlin school administration .
the German Student Services estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state of asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ er@@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law , if they begin studying .
the latter generally do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of af@@ ici@@ on@@ ous persons .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be reduced to 15 months .
but this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Student Services .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches &quot; right to a new state @-@ religion relationship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wel@@ fare Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take heed of religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ igh@@ ten such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and for what international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention Germany undertake , must in the coming years become reality if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , the chairman of the Medical Association , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all of the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards immediately .
provided services could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to see so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors do above all to create language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven , migrants are more informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , they demand .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical stops in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
in refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treat@@ able disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ enlightenment .
in some other cases , German doctors che@@ er clear from their education , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is possibly even allevi@@ ation in sight by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed education system , several refugees were even doctors .
to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the German psycho@@ therapist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who suffers from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death penalty .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill @-@ sick refugees get psycho@@ therapy .
while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in social establishments , mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ interpretations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ ti@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ ure staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for the lovers is thus in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family has captiv@@ ated the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo wants to accept it loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify themselves with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ cla@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ulations .
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
to@@ dd@@ lers fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are just too often the topic of various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at his attitude : &quot; if our animals are not good , it is not good for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
the highest command therefore : good for the animals .
specially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived in a walk eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or a hundred spectators , we always give our best and are with our whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst ad@@ ministers from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sam@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous fat@@ alities and warned them of accompanying Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with the calling of repentance .
last month , they had rested him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the State in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reductions lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of shops supporting businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of premi@@ er Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of wild animals since its debut six years ago .
he also played 157 league players in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career that he deserves .
Ar@@ senal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and the Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and treat players who need a little bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorites are to continue through Gruppe F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven from the distant hope of leading the club to its first European @-@ European triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Ar@@ senal .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons on male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate as ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 year high level .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritually healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the era of communication led through social media , with its focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ ve@@ able and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during the football match in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowing that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone soul I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ mitting suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can cope with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider @-@ status over the phone to help people in moments of despair also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the perfect backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League , Maria meets on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
the Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , there was no clas@@ h game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up beautifully in the long corner of the network in Johan Wil@@ and .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but except for a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps Post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the Gl@@ en@@ core business registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .

the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to blo@@ t around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new hol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , took place on 25 September and said President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders led bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to constructive approach areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on their way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona back then .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times champion League winner , two times Club World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing in Barcelona before the Euro 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won all , we have nothing at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great Euro . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , switched the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the filling of the film and not in the lin@@ eup of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian settled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to handle the figure of the Harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove , which is beaten by her white stri@@ pe .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against the am@@ bush .
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
the competition show , which just finished her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last job was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fighting victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so very suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge over it .
he has just been so happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt as if they had di@@ pped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past , they once were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb within a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card space .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inside for 6 times and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to disc@@ ard each game in bul@@ l@@ do@@ cks , and therefore I want to go into the game completely concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the dru@@ m@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Eli@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ se@@ er , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three races at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a b@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth downtown , Berlin managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed player stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit was benef@@ iting at the start of the game by a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ band gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z finished his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third that ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not been very well beaten , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ics right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns in six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against the T@@ wins .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived in it will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden told on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other local authorities .
over the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen arrived in H@@ esse for the first time , according to the head of the government responsible for the initial up@@ take .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective departure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Federal Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call it concrete numbers and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee stream in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who needed protection , also complain .
but those who do not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany either .
this opinion was intim@@ id@@ ated in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous strain of power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania must be sealed with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from hiding across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , for the sake of e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants have reported on the way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the iron arm@@ our of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean swe@@ eps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon easily di@@ ets on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too large for a solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers are presenting their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known that under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing in Munich for several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 1860 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; München &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must reno@@ unce around one month on the offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation conducted an ad@@ duc@@ tory injury with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected to be forced for four weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ com@@ mitt@@ al professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussions , Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ in O@@ ko@@ tie can return to the team training again next week .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training .
O@@ ko@@ tie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h on the head .
contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious es@@ cor@@ t .
no diet fruit - man@@ go contains a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. All above all , man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are thus supporting visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ gos , man@@ gan@@ os should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf algae like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the US parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company had already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday .
above all drivers are being sought .
last year , U@@ PS had already increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 means .
given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries of parcel services had brought harsh criticism .
first F@@ öh@@ n@@ ado , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the valleys of the F@@ öh@@ n Alps break through , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland , on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n partly blows with storm @-@ strength through the F@@ öh@@ n@@ valleys .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western flow .
on the side of the Alps the valley breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows up to Thursday morning in the valleys with arches from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ an@@ ar@@ cs of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday there are stor@@ my hair for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the mountain@@ side .
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , South of the Alps must be reck@@ oned with partly over 100 litres of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours , this after great rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the air is blowing , as a result of a cold front with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind blows strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go far back .
the following days are present in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now an Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Reform@@ ers on Wednesday .
on the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were able to live only in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place will become visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time as a promising sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .
in then , with his theses , Luther had initiated the spl@@ itting of the Western Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it may seem quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles which focus on topics such as cross @-@ road , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpre@@ ts the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into contemporary contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work to do so , perhaps to bring me back to the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to play an important role in art in a short time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this regard I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I was not careful not to grasp the Bible completely , but chose the important , also mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and of the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X train
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth@@ ware for a circular course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn , it was already finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured the dr@@ one , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill slo@@ ping , new space looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will take place in October , the first municipal h@@ unter Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was able to report in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga continues to mark a clear mark on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy to help overcome these problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can nobody say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State for Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
the decisive turn@@ outs , however , must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Con@@ federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues to run until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal Li@@ sts also support this program .
already this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign if they will carry the stamp on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; we help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport manager Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matter of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can football Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our beam force , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
for the European qualifying game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license associations have started their own projects in their locations is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year and next year , together with the DF@@ B and the Federal Government , the association will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already rec@@ alled the whole of 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Chief Executive Officer lo@@ oses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he had fallen to a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then drag@@ ged out on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up once you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mis@@ h ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
as a result , he also comes to Singapore on the weekend as a spare @-@ keeper for both Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reck@@ on with a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its root eleven at the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the door@@ keeper position .
therefore novel Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal @-@ keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ chel was open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marco is not that wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to changing the car . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio .
a test track is currently being tested on the motorway 9 in Bavaria for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to raise the permitted top speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving @-@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site will estimate the authors of the study by 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger car can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D MEP S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly defined .
however , German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent reck@@ ons not at all in 20 years , 31 per cent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those questioned by 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
at least 15 percent could be imagined on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under any circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing mine in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Council Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an end .
it is a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became a big star in the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om pav@@ ement on the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good idea that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ die . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total artwork , for which much effort was carried out : in order to fr@@ ze the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list has been actively engaged .
14 tons of material , according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , ended up in Munich .
shortly before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he later taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example for blankets and curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vable P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener peak , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vintage @-@ Mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of their jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies association with nine other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they may carry the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken off .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains .
moreover , exports are currently weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the USA .
there are enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association also seeks to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer says of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger exterior of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine sn@@ aps up small pots at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener peak - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and would like to have a reminder .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open out@@ wards to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group assigned to the reform of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new spin @-@ offs and driving forward reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants &apos;s milking system .
according to the statement , a negative list will be created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure that companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , thereby making consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish at present 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they meet the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction , which only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates strongly over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities are particularly caused by un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains in its homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cited in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
