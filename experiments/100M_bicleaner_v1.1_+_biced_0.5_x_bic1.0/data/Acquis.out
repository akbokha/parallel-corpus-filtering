in view of the fact that an agreement between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Con@@ federation has been signed in Geneva on 30 June 1967 ,
considering that it is necessary to take additional measures with regard to the smooth functioning of this agreement ,
in view of the decree of the Swiss Federal Council on 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches ,
given the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the watch@@ making industry ,
according to the knowledge of the ration@@ alization premi@@ ums granted by E@@ bau@@ ches SA and A@@ SU@@ AG at the time of the entry into force of this agreement and that at the same time the quot@@ a mentioned in point B ( B ) of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned agreement is aboli@@ shed ,
the customs measures envis@@ aged in articles 1 and 5 of 30 June 1967 coinci@@ de with this agreement at the same time .
1 . the raw materials produced in the Community are listed in the list attached to the agreement , as well as the constitu@@ ent components manufactured in the Community and other components of the movement , which are manufactured in Switzerland or in the community , are deemed to be of equivalent quality as raw materials and individual parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical properties .
clo@@ cks and movements composed of these pieces and components must meet the requirements of legal technical control in Switzerland .
2 . the list of raw materials produced in Par@@ agraph 1 is periodi@@ cally revised in accordance with the following mod@@ alities :
a ) The application for inclusion of new raw materials in the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community , or from the local producers of raw materials to the Swiss C@@ ow Chamber . the application is to add a technical description of the utility cali@@ ber .
the Swiss watch chamber immediately carries this or the new cali@@ bers in the so @-@ called list .
if the recording in the list for a pipe @-@ based calibration has already been applied , which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the legal technical inspection in Switzerland , the Swiss watch chamber can reject acceptance .
B ) The re @-@ education of the cler@@ ks listed in the list will be communicated by the associations of the watch industry of the community or from the manufacturer who previously applied for admission to the Swiss watch chamber .
C ) If the requirements of statutory technical control are not provided in Switzerland , the Swiss C@@ ow Chamber may request the sub@@ mitting of the relevant municipal utility cali@@ bres from the list ; it teaches the party concerned thereof .
if this does not agree , the procedure may take place in paragraph 3 within two months .
D ) E@@ ach request to change the list according to the letters a ) , b ) and c ) shall be immediately displayed to the Mi@@ xed Price from the Swiss C@@ ow Chamber .
3 . in order to reward the quality of the quality , the Mi@@ xed Commission , given in Article 9 of the Agreement of 30 June 1967 , is immediately seized by the parties concerned .
the first acting party is requested by the Institute for the official quality control in the Swiss watch industry , as well as a qualified institute of the community called by the party of the community in order to obtain a common report .
with regard to this report , the institutes argue that a game of watches or movements can be seen from a Swiss company and a company of the community , which is sufficiently representative and comprises no more than 50 clo@@ cks or movements .
after checking these games according to the norms of legal technical control in Switzerland , the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Mi@@ xed Commission with their conclusions and with their event@@ ual proposals .
the agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watch@@ makers by the relevant professional associations .

B ) All amendments must be subject to the agreement of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment to this Agreement .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures for entry into force are complete .
B ) This agreement remains in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures necessary in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as necessary .
the objective of the safegu@@ arding measures established in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear fis@@ sion bodies for unknown purposes and the deter@@ rence of such a branch through the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ use with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organisation is carried out by an explanation , in which the material quantity which is not specified for a certain period of time is specified for each material balance zone , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization is making full use of the Community &apos;s security system after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , see how they are more determined and practical in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of core material and invent@@ ories ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) determination , verification and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and report system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the one @-@ off and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) Take precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safety measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear @-@ fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ opic application , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if the core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear circuit , is introduced into the States , it is subject to the other safegu@@ ards mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not authorized , the Community is not possible or requested from resi@@ dues , so consult the organization and the community on the application of appropriate preventive measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is virtually non @-@ reversible .
upon request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures pursuant to this Convention :
a ) special split@@ table material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , of these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire amount of material released in the states is at no time more than
a ) a total of a kilograms of special cle@@ av@@ age material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ fi@@ v@@ ous square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed , processed or stored along with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken to the material .
the Community meets with the organisation supple@@ mental agreements , which are necessary to determine how the procedures defined in the Convention are applicable to the successful and effective completion of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or changed in agreement between the organization and the community without any modification of this agreement .
the supple@@ mental agreements come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible following the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this deadline requires the take @-@ up between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report cited in Article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated inventory of the underlying core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its subsequent investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organization )
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the E@@ EC organisation has presented a table from which it can be seen in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; special interaction account , &quot; which consists of the funds allocated to the Member States in accordance with this Agreement to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to as &quot; ste@@ ward &quot; by the organization ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; ste@@ wards &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions should be paid as follows : a ) Payment will be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debit balances of the Member State , which are to be paid at the request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the application within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may request payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing to cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transaction bank appropriately .
in the granting of these loans , the ste@@ ward can be guided by the following factors according to the E@@ EC conditions :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further bor@@ rowing capacity to loan terms without discounts ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the ordinary funding of the organization to be taken into account .
the funds of the Special Custom@@ s Account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which is subject to a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions granted to the organization provided by the organization ; they are thus re@@ pay@@ able in ten years each in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ pay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this bi@@ dding are directly to the organization that retains them .
any special transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the income from any special transaction loan can be used for expendi@@ tures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or executed ( ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and who , according to the measure of what the administrator determined at the time of loan guarantee , may be benef@@ ici@@ aries of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a Member State is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC to fully commit all special funds to the E@@ EC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the ste@@ ward and the E@@ EC are brief@@ ed quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
as soon as possible , the ste@@ ward transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this account closure .
following the full payment of the special transaction , the ste@@ ward of the E@@ EC will send a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the ste@@ wards work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrators up to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction funds from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action , and on any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement came into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the E@@ EC and the organisation entered into force , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately .
if the total amount of all the funds provided by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC according to the proced@@ ural terms of each party .
the governments of the Member States have notified the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures concerned .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat will forward these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the correct approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two Manus@@ cripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding being equally engaging .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to am@@ end the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T en@@ acted the following UN@@ IC@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called the &quot; Commission . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a common company according to chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Shar@@ ed Enterprise JET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since extensive work is carried out up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to consoli@@ date their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have acquired a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement should enable any contracting party to benefit from the merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma metap@@ hysi@@ cs from the funds provided for the research work , i.e. , to achieve the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program@@ s . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation between the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be expanded or modified by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties receive a new program , this is the place of the programmes listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II to the present Agreement .
the association offered in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programmes of the other party ;
- the exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present Agreement , as well as the laboratories carried out at Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates at the JET .
with regard to the implementation of the association designated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those referred between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the participation in the JET project , Switzerland , with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , belongs to the common company JET , whose statutes it accepts .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement .
the association agreement includes , in particular , the setting up of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible outcomes in line with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by no more than two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities within the Eur@@ atom Programme , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated organs and addresses their T * ity in the interests of both parties to the common goal established in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme and in accordance with the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking .
the advisory groups , which the VG research proposals aim to provide the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , perceive this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
the Committee of Directors , who has to supervis@@ e the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , provide this task with regard to all research and development work that falls under the present agreement .
it is especially responsible for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme .

the VG &apos;s opinion on the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two parties are working on the works of all technical advis@@ ors or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom Programme in line with this agreement is set annually on an amount which is at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the JET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom as soon as it is established .
moreover , Switzerland transfers the same amount to the Common Enterprise JET , which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the constitution of this common company .
the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works within the context of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis that is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding agreements .
the Commission will report to the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount is envis@@ aged to cover spending within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council is paying the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a period of six months .
in the form of a letter change to am@@ end the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify procedures for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the case of renewed changes in customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest that you make an appointment for the entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of medium @-@ term financial support
the B@@ IS could include stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application .
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of EUR 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future member states &apos;s future delivery funds .
already , however , some conditions have already been mentioned , for which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by loan , the B@@ IS would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing renew@@ als without however being exceeded for a total of five years .
with the opening of the loans as well as its possible extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a loan agreement commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws should not be made before the exp@@ iry of one month following the completion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would be carried out in the B@@ IS at the conclusion of the agreement at the available currencies , very likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take into account the funds provided by the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those applied to the BI@@ Z at the time under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds itself on the market , the interest rate to be applied could be reached a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could include stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to share with you the approval of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this letter .
in the conviction that stronger international cooperation should be carried out in such a way that greater liber@@ alisation , stability and expansion in international trade with meat and living animals will be contributed ;
taking into account the need to avoid serious disrup@@ tions in international trade with beef and living cattle ;

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this agreement , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other sources of blood type determination and determination of blood intoler@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on Re@@ agents of Human Orig@@ in to blood group determination by signing this agreement or when laying its rati@@ fication , approval or accession documents by a statement directed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a Noti@@ fication directed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the Parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport , as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are urgently needed , provided that they themselves possess sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are made available to other contracting parties only on condition that it is not associated with any profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and only designated by the participating governments .
every consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to blood type determination must be accompanied by a certificate of being produced according to the provisions of the protocol .
the protocol and its system constitute an administrative agreement that can be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the Parties to this Convention .

after the Convention enters into force , the Council of Europe &apos;s Committee of Ministers may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the timing of the Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement , in compliance with a period of one year , by announ@@ cing the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the th@@ inning is calculated exclusively by volume of blood @-@ body fl@@ ushing in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are drawn up at the time of standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ und@@ ations .
the ti@@ ter gives the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the final mix within a series where microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination which are present for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( currently Anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
once again , it brings them to a volume of 1 ml , so contain the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren as per definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the anti @-@ A ( S ) standard and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FIL@@ E = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the terms recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to label is at the most a year after the last satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily tested efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of shelf @-@ life tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dried re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosphor@@ ous pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement on a uniform system has been established .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to perform the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records of all levels of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and preserve the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups based on their effective share .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black and white label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , with dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate according to Article 4 of the Convention according to the system to this protocol .

furthermore , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative prevention against a fl@@ ushing of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum can in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted use of anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognis@@ able ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ und@@ ations of A1 and A2 blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same tests are carried out with the once dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

the following requirements on the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ized by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells which contain an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells which do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % salt solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an &quot; in@@ exhaus@@ tive &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ Rh@@ o serum or a corresponding comparison with C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum is said to react with blood cells that contain do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which is intended for the use of object carriers in accordance with the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with in@@ und@@ ations of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells which do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only if the tested blood cells are washed out in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 opposite C@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ized individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ vitamin or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the terms set by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ations@@ time in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , should not be smaller than the antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ized by blood cells or specific group A substances .

anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparison of blood cells in group B ( 1 ) .
if anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5 to 10 % flood of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same experiment with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity is carried out .
anti @-@ Human Glob@@ ulin serum for use in blood type ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against Ig@@ G glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors .
it is derived from the blood of animals that are immun@@ ized by inj@@ ecting human serum proteins .

the Parties to the European Convention on 14 May 1962 on the exchange of re@@ agents for blood group determination ( herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Convention &quot; ) -
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties of human origin from all input charges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this liberation falls into the competence of the community , which after the contract , by which it was established , possesses the necessary powers ;
from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming a contracting party of the supplementary protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notes the Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community of all accept@@ ances and any objection in accordance with Article 2 as well as the timing of the entry into force of this supplementary protocol according to Article 2 .

in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung that the Community within the Action Programme for Str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening the Single Market decided to introduce a uniform management paper as of 1 January 1988 in the inner @-@ community goods traffic .
in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by introducing a single administrative paper ,
in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung that this Convention may not be interpreted as a result of its obligations arising from other international agreements .
in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform management paper ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; uniform paper &quot; ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) .
the provisions associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are gro@@ unded by means of a single document , for which pre@@ prints are to be used in accordance with the samples in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention .
depending on the case , the standard paper is used as an application or paper for ex@@ portation , for shipping or import@@ ation .
- to be expressly requested to carry out the legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the single document ;
- must be demanded by the parties , so that they may come to the enjoyment of an advantage or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Agreement does not hin@@ der the contracting parties , simpli@@ fying procedures , including the use of data processing in order to apply further facilities for the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can in particular stipul@@ ate that the goods concerned are not to be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete registration can be admitted .
in these cases , a notification must subsequently be submitted to the competent authorities for a peri@@ odic registration , within which the deadline established by these authorities shall be submitted .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use trading sp@@ api@@ ere instead of the standard paper .
if the uni@@ fying paper is used , the parties can contribute with the consent of the competent authorities for the completion of all cases linked to the export and import duties , instead of the supplements to the standard paper in trade , in which the goods are described .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the provisions for their entire goods transport or for sub @-@ divisions ;
- in shipments which include several types of goods to use the for@@ warding in the shipping method of cargo lists instead of the supplement sheets to the standard paper ;
- allow applications to be made without pre @-@ printing by public or private data processing plants according to the conditions laid down by the competent authorities ;
- allow the competent authorities to request the data required for the provision of the relevant cases in their data processing systems for the treatment of the applications , and , if necessary , without giving a written notification ;
- allow the competent authorities to see in the event of the use of a data processing system for the handling of the applications , that the export , dispatch or import registration either by the single document created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant is established ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adopt improvements that have been adopted by the Council Committee on the path of a decision in accordance with article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the provisions necessary for the export , shipment and import of goods by means of the unit are settled in Anne@@ x II to this Convention .
( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the pre@@ prints given in the App@@ endi@@ x I , are to be found in Anne@@ x III to this Convention .
( 1 ) The registration must be made in one of the official languages of the contracting parties authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the provisions for the export or shipping are authorised .
