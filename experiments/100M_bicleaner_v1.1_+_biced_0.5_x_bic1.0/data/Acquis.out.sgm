<seg id="2">In view of the fact that an agreement between the European Economic Community and its Member States and the Swiss Confederation has been signed in Geneva on 30 June 1967,</seg>
<seg id="3">Considering that it is necessary to take additional measures with regard to the smooth functioning of this agreement,</seg>
<seg id="4">In view of the decree of the Swiss Federal Council on 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches,</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the watchmaking industry,</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the knowledge of the rationalization premiums granted by Ebauches SA and ASUAG at the time of the entry into force of this agreement and that at the same time the quota mentioned in point B (B) of the aforementioned agreement is abolished,</seg>
<seg id="7">The customs measures envisaged in articles 1 and 5 of 30 June 1967 coincide with this agreement at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">1. the raw materials produced in the Community are listed in the list attached to the agreement, as well as the constituent components manufactured in the Community and other components of the movement, which are manufactured in Switzerland or in the community, are deemed to be of equivalent quality as raw materials and individual parts of Swiss manufacturing with comparable technical properties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Clocks and movements composed of these pieces and components must meet the requirements of legal technical control in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">2. the list of raw materials produced in Paragraph 1 is periodically revised in accordance with the following modalities:</seg>
<seg id="11">A) The application for inclusion of new raw materials in the list is directed by the associations of the watch industry of the community, or from the local producers of raw materials to the Swiss Cow Chamber. the application is to add a technical description of the utility caliber.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Swiss watch chamber immediately carries this or the new calibers in the so-called list.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the recording in the list for a pipe-based calibration has already been applied, which has already been used in Switzerland and has not passed the legal technical inspection in Switzerland, the Swiss watch chamber can reject acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="14">B) The re-education of the clerks listed in the list will be communicated by the associations of the watch industry of the community or from the manufacturer who previously applied for admission to the Swiss watch chamber.</seg>
<seg id="15">C) If the requirements of statutory technical control are not provided in Switzerland, the Swiss Cow Chamber may request the submitting of the relevant municipal utility calibres from the list; it teaches the party concerned thereof.</seg>
<seg id="16">If this does not agree, the procedure may take place in paragraph 3 within two months.</seg>
<seg id="17">D) Each request to change the list according to the letters a), b) and c) shall be immediately displayed to the Mixed Price from the Swiss Cow Chamber.</seg>
<seg id="18">3. in order to reward the quality of the quality, the Mixed Commission, given in Article 9 of the Agreement of 30 June 1967, is immediately seized by the parties concerned.</seg>
<seg id="19">The first acting party is requested by the Institute for the official quality control in the Swiss watch industry, as well as a qualified institute of the community called by the party of the community in order to obtain a common report.</seg>
<seg id="20">With regard to this report, the institutes argue that a game of watches or movements can be seen from a Swiss company and a company of the community, which is sufficiently representative and comprises no more than 50 clocks or movements.</seg>
<seg id="21">After checking these games according to the norms of legal technical control in Switzerland, the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the Mixed Commission with their conclusions and with their eventual proposals.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watchmakers by the relevant professional associations.</seg>
<seg id="23">At least every three years, calculated by the entry into force of the agreement, the Mixed Commission introduces a redesign of the list in order to take account of the recent entries and matches.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973, unless the ratification certificates were replaced until that date.</seg>
<seg id="25">If the exchange of ratifications takes place between January 1 and November 30, 1973, the agreement will come into effect on the first day of the second month on the exchange of the following month.</seg>

<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organization)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) EEC and the organization have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the EEC organisation has presented a table from which it can be seen in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "special interaction account," which consists of the funds allocated to the Member States in accordance with this Agreement to the special transaction account; this account is referred to as "steward" by the organization (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "stewards"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separate and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions should be paid as follows: a) Payment will be made in the form of cash or non-interest debit balances of the Member State, which are to be paid at the request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the application within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may request payments in advance of the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes approximately proportional drawing to cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transaction bank appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the steward can be guided by the following factors according to the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further borrowing capacity to loan terms without discounts; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly payable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices used for the ordinary funding of the organization to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the Special Customs Account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which is subject to a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions granted to the organization provided by the organization; they are thus repayable in ten years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this bidding are directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any special transaction loan can be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The income from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditures in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are manufactured or executed (ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and who, according to the measure of what the administrator determined at the time of loan guarantee, may be beneficiaries of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a Member State is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker will instruct the EEC to fully commit all special funds to the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction loan, the steward and the EEC are briefed quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the steward transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement with an opinion from the external auditor of the organization for this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">Following the full payment of the special transaction, the steward of the EEC will send a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special interaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out of the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">"" "" "" "the EEC and the stewards work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrators up to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction funds from time to time give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction, the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action, and on any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement came into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date the EEC and the organisation entered into force, the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of all the funds provided by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been repaid and remitted to Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
